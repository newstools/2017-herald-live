The Nelson Mandela Bay ANC headquarters in Port Elizabeth Picture: Werner Hills Deputy Minister of Rural Development Mcebisi Skwatsha was held hostage at the Nelson Mandela Bay ANC headquarters on Saturday. Police spokeswoman Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said the public order policing unit was called to escort Skwatsha out of the building and away from angry protesters. The Nelson Mandela Bay ANC members were at loggerheads this morning with Skwatsha who had been deployed to the region to resolve infighting about which representatives would attend the party&#8217;s upcoming provincial conference. However, the situation turned hostile after there were claims that Skwatsha began to favour certain members before the rest of the people in attendance were allowed to voice their concerns. Skwatsha was escorted out of the building at 11am, about a hour after the conference started. Speaking outside the building, ANC member Andile Lungisa said there was no hostage situation as earlier reports suggested. &#8220;Nobody was being held against their will. There was simply a disagreement between the members present,&#8221; Lungisa said.
