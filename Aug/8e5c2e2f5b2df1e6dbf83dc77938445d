UDM president Bantu Holomisa File picture: Lulamile Feni The UDM is turning to the courts to challenge the recent Nelson Mandela Bay council decision to remove Mongameli Bobani as deputy mayor. UDM president Bantu Holomisa said their planned high court action stems from the DA&#8217;s rejection of their ultimatum to reinstate Bobani by Monday or they would would pull out of the coalition. In a letter to a number of opposition party leaders, including DA leader Mmusi Maimane and EFF commander in chief Julius Malema, Holomisa said they would seek &#8220;a legal remedy this Monday&#8221; He also challenged the DA to circulate a forensic report to all Bay councillors which is alleged to contain information implicating Bobani in corruption. The email, sent on Saturday, reads: &#8220;As a result of the DA&#8217;s rejection of our ultimatum to reinstate Bobani in his position by Monday , after he was wrongfully ousted in that chaotic council meeting of the 24 August 2017, please take note that the UDM will seek a legal remedy in court this coming Monday. &#8220;High on our papers will be the issues of procedure as outlined in the municipality&#8217;s rules and regulations&#8221;. Bobani was voted out with 60 votes from the DA, PA, ACDP and COPE while opposition parties were walking out ofthe council. While there are opposing views about whether or not the meeting had a quorum because opposition councillors were standing and others waking out, city manager Johann Mettler said on Thursday that 60 was a majority of the number of councillors in the chamber at the time. He said all councillors who were still in the chamber were regarded as being present, regardless of whether or not they were standing. Meanwhile, Holomisa added in his email: &#8220;We will also demand in our papers, that the DA must circulate the [Pricewaterhouse Coopers] report to all councilors of the NMBMM &#8220;The DA leadership has been making noise claiming that they have prima-facie evidence of corruption against Bobani. &#8220;On Monday, in our court papers, the DA leadership will be called upon to bring to court their so-called prima-facie evidence&#8221;. Holomisa added: &#8220;This is yet another attempt to display that we are committed to continue serving in the coalition government at NMBM. &#8220;However, the UDM will not fold her arms whilst the DA is undermining other coalition partners and in the process continue to assassinate the character of Bobani. &#8220;This kind of total onslaught campaign against Bobani and the UDM was common during the apartheid days&#8221;.
