The DA has launched a petition calling for early emergency elections saying it believes the ANC has lost the confidence of the majority of South Africans and that parliament requires a new beginning through the ballot box. DA national spokeswoman Phumzile van Damme said in the August 8 vote on the motion of no confidence in President Jacob Zuma it was clear the ANC was willing to do anything to protect this corrupt president . The ANC would do anything to keep Zuma in power and, while it fights itself parliament was becoming dysfunctional, she said.
