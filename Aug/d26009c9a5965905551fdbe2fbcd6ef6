ANC Eastern Cape provincial secretary Oscar Mabuyane File picture: Annelisa Swana The ANC must find out which of its MPs secretly voted with the opposition in the motion of no confidence against President Jacob Zuma so they can be disciplined. This is the view of Eastern Cape provincial secretary Oscar Mabuyane. He said although the South African constitution protected the wayward MPs, high-ranking ANC officials should seek to identify the politicians. The constitution of the country must not be used to destabilise the ANC, he said. The Eastern Cape ANC has now joined KwaZulu-Natal and Free State in calling for action against its MPs who voted against the party in the motion of confidence on August 8. It is estimated that at least 25 ANC MPs sided with opposition parties, while even more abstained from the vote. The ANC constitution is clear that this is an act of misconduct but it is also a culmination of ongoing ill-discipline in the party, Mabuyane said. He said both the DA and EFF had disciplined members for defying the party when they voted with the ANC in Mogale City. But political analyst Somadoda Fikeni said calls to unearth the identities of the wayward MPs was counter-productive for the party and it would be nearly impossible to do so. The question that we should ask is what are those MPs being hunted for? he asked. Is it for not following the party line or not following the public interest or is it bringing the organisation into disrepute? You will be surprised that some of those who are calling for action are actually ring leaders. It is like oil calling for the cleaning up of water.
