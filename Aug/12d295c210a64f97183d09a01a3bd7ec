A sangoma has been arrested for assault after a woman training under her burnt her feet while walking over hot coals. Nomatamsanqa Madlamini Meze, 45, was arrested at the weekend and appeared in court on Monday on charges of assault with the intent to cause grievous bodily harm. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said the arrested stemmed from an incident last month in which Pumeze Lugawu, 40, of New Brighton was admitted to Dora Nginza Hospital with serious burns on both feet. The incident happened on 8 July 2017 when the victim was undergoing a training ritual as a sangoma, and was forced to walk over burning coals, Beetge said. Lugawu opened a case with police on Friday and Meze was arrested the next day. Meze appeared in the New Brighton Magistrate s Court where she was granted R300 bail. The case was postponed to October 19.
