Edward Zuma Picture: Thuli Dlamini President Jacob Zuma s son Edward had until midnight last night to retract offensive remarks he made against senior ANC leaders Pravin Gordhan and Derek Hanekom or face the music. The ANC in KwaZulu-Natal wants Edward to retract his vitriolic open letter in which he called former finance minister Gordhan a stooge of white monopoly capital and former tourism minister Hanekom a white Afrikaner askari . ANC provincial spokesman Mdumiseni Ntuli said yesterday Edward had been told he had five days to retract and apologise for the comments. If Edward does not comply he will be hauled before a disciplinary hearing. We said he must withdraw the statement especially the areas that we felt were offensive. He has until midnight today to do so. Ntuli said the party s provincial executive committee which is meeting this weekend would have to decide on how to deal with Edward should he not apologise to Gordhan and Hanekom. But a defiant Edward was reported as saying on Monday he would not retract his statement. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
