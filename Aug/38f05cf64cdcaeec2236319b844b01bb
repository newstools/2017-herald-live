African National Congress MPs on Tuesday voted to keep Jacob Zuma as South Africa&#8217;s president. The #ZumaVote results are: 198 no 177 yes and 9 abstentions. The total number of votes cast were 384. This means that 40 ANC MPs rebelled against the ruling party. The voting on the motion of no confidence in Zuma was held through a secret ballot in parliament. Zuma&#8217;s opponents had needed 201 votes out of 400 for the motion to succeed. The ANC has 249 seats so all opposition members and at least 50 ANC MPs would have had to vote in favour of the motion for Zuma to be ousted. &nbsp; Speaking to ANC supporters at the gates of parliament shortly after the results were announced police minister Fikile Mbalula said Zuma was going nowhere. &#8220;Asijiki we are not going to be told Zuma must &#8211; if he must go he will be removed by us as the ANC. &#8220;We have defeated the useless motion. We can&#8217;t dance to Mmusi Maimane and all the small boys and girls. People who vote with the motion are suicide bombers. In a statement the ANC said it has reclaimed its position as leader of the society. &#8220;The ANC regards it as paramount that not just our elected representatives but all South Africans are able to engage on the most critical issues facing our country without fear or favour. &#8220;The biggest victor of today s event is our constitutional dispensation. It once again reaffirms the ANC s position as the leader of society in that the country s MPs are able to exercise this critical constitutional provision aimed at safeguarding our democracy. &#8220;Whilst the ANC has consistently noted the numerous challenges facing our democracy as presented by the political opposition at the same time we cannot lose sight of the record of success and achievement under the ANC government as presented by ANC MPs in today s debate.&#8221; ANC Chief Whip Jackson Mthembu said his focus was not on the numbers but on the fact that they had defeated the motion. &#8220;To us that&#8217;s the most important thing and the ANC has never been an organisation that&#8217;s punitive. we were confident that we&#8217;re going to defeat this thing. &#8220;Yes there might be some members of the ANC who might have voted with the opposition but for now the most important aspect is that this vote of no confidence has been defeated. The ANC MPs have not sold out to the DA or the opposition. ANC MPs have defended the ANC we have refused to embolden the opposition. &#8220;All these other things are things that we will look at study them study the maths of who was here and then take it from there but it has never been the DNA of the ANC to be punitive. &#8220;If I was still drinking I would say I am going to get a bottle but I am no longer drinking so I must go and get some bottle of water or juice.&#8221; &nbsp; Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
