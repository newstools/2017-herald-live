Bethelsdorp Check out the top 50 areas in South Africa where most of the housing stock is below R600 000 you may not be surprised to see that Port Elizabeth has at least three suburbs in the mix. Before answering the question of where the most affordable housing in South Africa is, national estate agency group Private Property looks at what it means by affordable housing in South Africa. According to a GroundUp article, the term affordable housing is generally used by government officials, activists and politicians but its explanation remains vague. For the purposes of this report, Private Property has defined affordable housing as low-cost property with an asking price of no more than R600,000. The data used in the article was gathered by Private Property for the year from April 1 2016 to 31 March 2017. Comparing provinces In order to compare regions for housing affordability, the Private Property data shows which provinces have the highest percentage of affordable housing (housing with an asking price of no more than R600,000), and identifies which suburbs in each province have an affordable (no more than R600,000) median asking price. For the year evaluated, the gathered data shows that the Eastern Cape ranked at the top for having the highest percentage of affordable housing. While the median asking price for all listings in the Eastern Cape was R1,150,000, in the more affordable suburbs of Motherwell, Bethelsdorp and Algoa Park low-income earners could expect to pay an average of R377,500, R415,000 and R578,750 respectively for housing. Further up the coast, Mdantsane also falls into this bracket, with an average house price of R365,000. The median asking price for all listings in the Free State was R1,030,000, while suburbs such as Willows, Navalsig and the Bloemfontein CBD had a median asking price of R385,000, R480,000 and R499,000 respectively. The average asking price for all listings in the North West province was R1,240,000, but low-income earners could expect to pay around R460,000 for housing in the suburb of Boitekong, and around R566,500 in Stilfontein. As expected, the Western Cape had the highest median asking price for all listings, at R1,995,000. However, low-income earners could still buy affordable housing in areas such as Delft, Khayelitsha, Mitchells Plain, Maitland, Macassar and Blue Downs with median asking prices at R310,000, R380,000, R509,000, R510,000, R549,500 and R580,000. Although the Gauteng region ranks number four with its percentage of low-cost listings in the past year, the province had the highest number of suburbs with affordable median asking prices, with 39 suburbs with a median asking price of R600,000 and under. Many of South Africa s low and middle-income earners only have the option of settling for apartments or houses in affordable urban areas, as prices for townhouses are becoming less affordable for this income group. The data taken from Private Property shows that almost 50% of low-cost listings were in the form of apartments, and 55% had two bedrooms. It s good to see that low and middle-income earners might still afford to get a three-bedroom home, as the data indicates that 22% of low-cost listings still offers three bedrooms. This percentage changes considerably when looking at four-bedroom homes, with only 1% of low-cost listings offering this. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
