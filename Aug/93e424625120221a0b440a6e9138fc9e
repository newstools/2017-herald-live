Musician and songwriter Donald Moatshe was in Port Elizabeth yesterday to promote his new CD One of South Africa s most popular songs almost never made it onto the airwaves as singer Donald Moatshe never knew where the money to complete his visual album would come from. Moatshe s single, Rain Drops, which features Nigerian vocalist Tiwa Savage, has been at the top of the charts since its release. It forms part of his album Something More, but Moatshe, 32, said he had to take a financial risk to get the album out. It was pretty straining financially and emotionally because I took all the money I had made from my previous albums and put it into this project. There were moments where I didn t know where the money would come from or how it would come, he said. Moatshe was in Port Elizabeth yesterday to talk about his fourth studio album, which came out earlier this year. If you re going do something groundbreaking, game-changing, something s got to give, whether you like it or not. For me to make such a historic moment, I needed to invest in myself instead of getting someone to pay for it, he said. The Afro-soul singer s visual album is a first in South Africa and boasts collaborations with international musicians in an effort to widen his audience. The album contains 10 songs and 10 videos. Moatshe said with Something More he wanted to expand on what he had given fans with his previous albums such as Black and White and Train of Love. I went a little deeper into the subjects I talked about. I m more vulnerable, I ve matured, grown and I m able to express myself more in terms of love. He said the album had been planned to not have any collaborations but the mixing of Rain Drops with Savage changed that. Rain Drops was actually a finished song with my own second verse. She came to SA, got into the studio and recorded her own verse and we shot the video.
