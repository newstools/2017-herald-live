&#8216;Anyone Can Do Leatherwork&#8217; by Geert Schuiling Anyone Can Do Leartherwork by Geert Schuiling, published by Metz Press for R295 Metz Press offers a wide range of craft books written by experts in their respective fields think of Port Elizabeth s own Angie Franke, for example, who has written several excellent books on fabric art and other disciplines for this publisher. However, until now there have been very few titles for those who enjoy the more macho crafts like metal work, and of those which have been published, very few have been written by male professionals. Along comes Geert Schuiling with an extremely hands-on book, Anyone Can Do Leatherwork. Schuiling, who joined Woodheads in Cape Town 20 years ago, has built up a solid reputation in the leather business. You can start off with something small like a keyring, but the 50 projects in the book also include more ambitious creations such as bags, and the patterns have been adapted for hand-stitching to make them accessible for home hobbyists. It is also available in Afrikaans as Enigeen Kan Leerwerk Doen. Gillian McAinsh
