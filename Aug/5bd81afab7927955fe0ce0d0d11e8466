The Motherwell police cluster commander has expressed concern over the increase in severity of protest violence in the KwaDwesi area. This follows incidents in the New Mission Road area in Westville, KwaDwesi on Wednesday (16/08/17) in which 10 vehicles &#8211; mostly bakkies and light delivery vehicles &#8211; were stoned by about 150 residents. Two more bakkies worth about R280 000 were set alight. On Thursday (17/08/17), another vehicle was set alight and several more, including two polices vehicles, were pelted with stones. Motherwell cluster commander Major-General Dawie Rabie said he was concerned about the growing violence and ordered extra policing to stabilise the situation. &#8220;The South Africa Police Service members are there to serve and protect our communities but when communities start to attack the police, strong action will be taken against perpetrators,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Housing issues should be dealt with without causing unrest in order for SAPS to focus on more serious crimes being committed in those communities.&#8221; The unrest has been taking place sporadically over the past three weeks, but have increased in seriousness, police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said. &nbsp;
