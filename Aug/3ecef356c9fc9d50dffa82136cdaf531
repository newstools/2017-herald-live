Kissing is identified as one of the most popular sexual behaviours among both men and women in a new US study. Contrary to some stereotypes the most appealing behaviours even for men are romantic and affectionate behaviours lead author on the study, Professor Debby Herbenick said. These included kissing more often during sex cuddling saying sweet/romantic things during sex making the room feel romantic in preparation for sex and so on. More than 2 000 Americans roughly half men and half women were asked about the appeal of nearly 50 sexual activities in the latest study one of the first to record a range of behaviours in the general population. Common lifetime sexual behaviours also included: wearing sexy lingerie/underwear (75% women 26% men); sending/receiving digital nude/semi-nude photos (54% women 65% men); watching sexually explicit videos/DVDs (60% women 82% men); reading erotic stories (57% of all participants); public sex (about 43%) and role-playing (approximately 22%) tying/being tied up (about 20%) spanking (approximately 30%). More unusual were engaging in threesomes (10% women 18% men) and playful whipping (about 13%). Lifetime group sex sex parties taking a sexuality class or workshop and going to BDSM parties were uncommon (each approximately 8%) the researchers said. More Americans identified behaviours as appealing than had taken part in them. Herbenick said the findings would allow couples to talk more openly about their sexual desires and interests. Together they may find new ways of being romantic or sexual with one another enhancing both their sexual satisfaction and relationship happiness she said. Researchers from the Centre for Sexual Health Promotion at the Indiana University School of Public Health-Bloomington conducted the Sexual Exploration in America study published online on Tuesday in PLOS One.
