Uitenhage police are searching for four men who allegedly robbed a courier delivery vehicle at lunchtime on Monday (14/08/17). Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said the robbery occurred at about 1.30pm when the vehicle, travelling in Queen Mary Crescent, Uitenhage, was pushed off the road. The driver and two passengers were in the vehicle. &#8220;Two armed suspects climbed into the delivery vehicle and drove 200m towards a parking area. A bakkie pulled in next to the delivery vehicle and the suspects offloaded electronic devices into their vehicle,&#8221; Swart said. &#8220;The value of the property taken was determined at thousands of rands. The four male suspects fled with the equipment and drove off in a white bakkie.&#8221; Swart asked anyone with information to contact Uitenhage police on 041-996 3438. &nbsp; Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
