The US branch of embattled German carmaker Volkswagen is recalling 281 000 vehicles to fix a faulty fuel pump. While the number is far smaller than the 11 million cars worldwide recalled in the dieselgate emissions cheating scandal, news of another problem comes as the company is trying to restore its image with customers. The company informed US regulators it is recalling 2009-2016 CC luxury sedans and 2006-2010 Passat and Passat Wagons due to problems with the fuel pump. Interruption of electrical power to the fuel pump control module may cause the fuel pump to fail. If the fuel pump fails, the engine will stall, increasing the risk of a crash, it said in a letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. A VW spokesman said it knew of no injuries or accidents caused by the defect. The company said it would replace the defective fuel pumps at no cost. However, the new parts &#8212; from a different supplier than the original &#8212; are currently unavailable .
