Minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini File picture: Ruvan Boshoff After her ludicrous comments reported at the weekend, ANC Women s League president and Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini needs to go. What else can we say in the aftermath of the recent physical assault on two women allegedly by Higher Education Deputy Minister Mduduzi Manana? Particularly when Manana apologised for the attack and does not dispute the victims accusations. Among other horrors, Dlamini noted the first step was not to remove him due to his violent actions because, of those who occupy a senior position in government, there are those that are actually worse them (sic) him . Really? Are you saying that your colleagues are a bunch of women-beaters with fragile egos and a reputation for being a boss from hell ? Furthermore, if you know of criminals in the cabinet, then it is your duty to name them, honourable minister. Or, if you do not name them in public, then at least provide the authorities with the necessary information to investigate and lay charges so that justice may be done and then seen to be done. It beggars belief that you, as head of an organisation set up to advance the cause of women, can actually admit this. What is more it came not in an unguarded moment, but in an interview with a national newspaper. We find this inconceivable unless you are totally out of touch with public opinion, perhaps due to other agendas. Ms Dlamini, you are defending this man with the most insane logic and you may have taken over from Julius Malema in making intemperate and inflammatory comments which enrage large sectors of society. However, whereas Malema often alienated whites you, honourable member, are alienating your own sex. We agree with political commentator Garth van Onselen, who dubs you a walking moral vacuum . Your double standards are a disgrace. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
