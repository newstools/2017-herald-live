Opulent: Aishwarya Rai Bachchan Pared back: Kristen Stewart Yves St Laurent: Tallia Storm Cover up: Tilda Swinton, Julianne Moore, Juliette Binoche Ride the train: Kendall Jenner Take the plunge: Amanda Steele Catsuit: Sara Sampaio The Cannes Film Festival has been celebrating movie star glamour, highlighting the collaboration of red carpet with the catwalk over 10 days in the south of France. Jessica Chastain, Nicole Kidman, Uma Thurman, Tilda Swinton and other A-list Hollywood stars always show more than their acting skill on the Riveria at the festival. This year the stylists&#8217; choices veered between the extremes, with sleek minimal looks increasingly making way for excess and opulence. Bollywood queen Aishwarya Rai Bachchan opted for the latter, verging on fancy dress in her voluminous Cinderella blue ballgown on one day and a flaming red ruffled confection on the next. This was in stark contrast to Twilight s Kristin Stewart whose bleached close-crop was perhaps the most pared down of the looks. Occasion wear ranged from uber-elegant to over-the-top ball gowns with designers such as Dior, Valentino, Chanel and other top French and Italian designers. &nbsp; Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
