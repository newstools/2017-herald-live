Picture: Anthony Molyneaux Hundreds of people crammed a hall in Cape Town on Saturday (20/05/17) to say their last farewell to three-year-old Courtney Pieters. A crowd gathered outside Adriaanse Hall in Clarke&#8217;s Estate Elsies River where pink white and yellow flowers were piled on the altar. Courtney s body arrived in a white casket after leaving the family home in Pluto Road. The three-year-old was found in a shallow grave next to unused railroad tracks in Epping a week ago. She had been missing for a week. Mortimer Saunders 40 who lived in the Pieters family home appeared in Goodwood Magistrate s Court on Wednesday charged with murder rape and kidnapping. Western Cape Community Safety MEC Dan Plato was at the funeral. He was also at a memorial service for Courtney held on Thursday the same day President Jacob Zuma visited the Pieters family home.
