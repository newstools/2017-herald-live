Pitso Mosimane Pitso Mosimane might be forced to field a weakened Mamelodi Sundowns team in Saturday s last league game of the season against Highlands Park. Sundowns are away at the Democratic Republic of Congo s AS Vita Club in Kinshasa today in the second group in defence of their Champions League crown. They then return home to play in Tembisa on the final day of the Premier Soccer League season against the relegationthreatened Highlands. Mosimane has given priority to the African Champions League Our worry about Kinshasa is playing on Wednesday [today] travelling back on Thursday [tomorrow] and arriving at night then on Friday it s one day of rest and then we have to play Highlands Park he said. In Kinshasa we have to try and make sure we don t lose because they are now bottom of the log and have a goal difference of minus two. So we ve got to play smart and keep them down there and we have to try and win here when we play at home again. AS Vita Club lost 3-1 to Esperance of Tunisia, while Sundowns played a disappointing 0-0 draw at home with St George of Ethiopia in their opening group games two weeks ago. On that artificial pitch in Kinshasa, really, we have to just try to do what we can and avoid going bottom of the log. It s OK now that the [South African] league is gone. That s a monkey off our backs and we ll see what we do with Highlands. Maybe we ll keep players away from that game against Highlands to ensure I have fresh players for Champions League. Sundowns are back in Champions League action the following Friday, June 2, at home to Esperance which will be their third group game but by fielding non-regulars against Highlands they put in jeopardy finishing second in the PSL which would qualify them for a third successive Champions League campaign.
