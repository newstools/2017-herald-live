Buli G MES (Mould, Empower, Serve), an NGO which helps the poor and destitute in cities around the country, is holding a fundraiser for its Port Elizabeth branch on Saturday night at La Colline in Lorraine. Accomplished MC, entertainer and former prime time TV and radio presenter Buli G will host the evening, which will feature classics from the Bond film Diamonds Are Forever. Buli G will also perform a repertoire of songs from the movie, as well as other movies in the Bond franchise. MES PE said it has many success stories illustrating that its clients are truly diamonds who start off as coal and through encouragement, time and nurturing can sparkle and become members who are able to add value to their communities . Our theme, Diamonds are Forever , symbolises the difference made in the lives of the homeless of our inner city, a spokesman for the NGO said. Their future potential is brought to the fore and realised via the projects and programmes presented by MES, and this ensures that they become the best they can be in order to advance to a sustainable exit. Your support will help fund these life-changing projects, the spokesman said. The evening will also include lucky draws and Two Sisters auctioneers will auction off a range of prizes which include Jenni Gault jewellery, weekend getaways, spa treatments and more. Mes has been working in the inner cities of Johannesburg, Cape Town and Port Elizabeth for 30 years, taking a holistic approach to helping people of all ages through its development programmes. Tickets are R300 per person or R3000 for a table of 10, and include a three-course meal. The evening starts at 7pm. To book a table, e-mail Alta at alta@mes.org.za.
