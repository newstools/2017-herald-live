One of Port Elizabeth s most wanted criminals has been arrested in a raid. Police will only name the man wanted for a string of crimes such as murder, hijacking and armed robbery once he has appeared in court. He was arrested on Sunday night, after being on the run from police for the past six months. Police spokesman captain Andre Beetge said police arrested the man, 27, after a tip-off that he had arrived home at Joe Slovo in KwaDwesi. He is the KwaDwesi police s most wanted suspect and also on the Port Elizabeth most wanted list, Beetge said. Several attempts to track him down have failed until this weekend. The man was released on bail in November but missed his next court hearing. He is believed to be linked to a hijacking in December, followed by an attempted murder in January, Beetge said. He will be charged with attempted murder, which is linked to a case in January. However, he is also a suspect in a series of murders and more charges could follow.
