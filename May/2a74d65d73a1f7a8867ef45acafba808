As hundreds of devotees sang and prayed outside the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court on Wednesday afternoon, the manner in which Omotoso allegedly lured teenaged girls into sexual relations was laid out in court. Horrific descriptions of how Omotoso would allegedly have the girls rub vaseline on their thighs while telling them to recite Psalm 51 a psalm that deals with sin and being cleansed were read out in court. Reading from a statement by investigating officer detective warrant officer Peter Plaatjies of The Hawks state prosecutor advocate Nceba Ntelwa told the court that Omotoso would then tell the girls that If they spoke about the encounters they would be cursed and would die. Omotoso was arrested at the Port Elizabeth Airport on April 20. National Hawks spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Robert Netshiunda confirmed Omotoso was facing 22 charges related to contravening the sexual offences act stemming from sexual assault to human trafficking with possible additional charges to be added at a later stage. It was the defences submission that Omotoso denied any wrongdoing and intended to stand trial to prove his innocence. Ntewla said the state would oppose bail because Omotoso was a flight risk, had no permanent residential address and would intimidate and interfere with state witnesses. He [Omotoso] has the propensity to commit the same crimes, he said. Members of the media and general public inside the court were instructed by members of the polices Tactical Response Team to switch off all cellphones and recording devices during court proceedings or face the consequences . One member of the TRT told the gallery that he would personally remove anyone whose cellphone lights up during proceedings. Omotoso is due back in court on Thursday.
