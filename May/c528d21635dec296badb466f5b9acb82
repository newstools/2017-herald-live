At this stage the circumstances surrounding the incident are unknown and police are investigating a case of murder. It is alleged that on Thursday morning, police were alerted to a vehicle parked in an open space at the bottom of Koyana Road in Veeplaas. When attending to the complaint, it was established that it was an unmarked police vehicle and the driver, a police detective was found in the driver s seat with gunshot wounds. While details remain sketchy, provincial police spokeswoman Brigadier Marinda Mills said: &#8220;I can only confirm that a detective member of the saps in Port Elizabeth was shot and killed in the line of duty this morning.&#8221; The SAPS Management in the Eastern Cape expressed their deepest condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of the late Mtshawu. Our hearts go out to his loved ones and close colleagues during this difficult time. Any person who attacks or kills a police official will face the full might of the law. An attack on or murder of a police official is a threat to our constitutional democracy and robs our communities of their protectors. This should not be taken lightly by anyone , said Lt Gen Liziwe Ntshinga. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
