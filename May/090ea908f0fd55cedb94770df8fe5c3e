Basic Education Minister Angie Motshekga has secretly slammed the SA Democratic Teachers Union (Sadtu) as being linked to the scandal in which teachers jobs were sold yet yesterday told parliament the exact opposite. Motshekga said during her budget vote: No evidence points to Sadtu [in the jobs scandal] which has been instrumental in the improvements we have seen in rural and poor schools. But in her submission to the SA Human Rights Commission, Motshekga mentioned they were implicated in selling jobs. The commission is investigating if teachers unions are denying children s constitutional right to education after the DA laid a complaint. DA spokesman on education, Gavin Davis, was highly critical of Motshekga s contradictions, saying she needed Sadtu for her political survival so would never criticise them in public. However, education spokeswoman Troy Martens said Motshekga was not contradicting herself. She said Motshekga meant in parliament that Sadtu was not behind the jobs-for-cash scandal although some rogue members may have been implicated.
