SACP general-secretary claims his party is being bugged Picture: Antonio Muchave / Sowetan South African Communist Party (SACP) general-secretary Blade Nzimande has repeated claims that his party is being bugged by intelligence operatives. It s totally unacceptable. We are being bugged and listened to as the apartheid regime used to do to us as communists before 1994 he told Radio 702 on Tuesday. He was elaborating on comments he made during a message of support at the 6th central committee meeting of the Congress of South African Trade Unions (Cosatu) in Pretoria on Monday. Apart from launching a scathing attack on the Gupta family he said that members of the SACP were being threatened for speaking truth to power. He told Radio 702 that we are absolutely certain that the SACP was under surveillance as was the case under apartheid. We are having people who are coming from inside the ranks of our own government actually doing the same things to us. It s unacceptable. Nzimande also complained about the party being under surveillance during a commemoration service for the late Chris Hani. &#8211; TMG Digital/TimesLIVE Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
