The bail application of human trafficking accused pastor Tim Omotoso continues in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate&#8217;s Court this morning. The controversial televangelist, who faces 22 charges related to contravening the Sexual Offences Act with two definite charges of rape contained in the charge sheet, was arrested at the Port Elizabeth International Airport last month. The 58-year-old who is a father of three is head of a Durban-based church. During the third day of his formal bail application earlier this month, Omotoso s movements in and out of South Africa raised suspicions when it was revealed that he had left South Africa at least three times with a new passport while his South African work permit was issued in his old passport. Immigrations officer with the department of home affairs Inspector Ivan Claasen said it was suspicious that Omotoso was able to leave the country and return when the passport he used did not contain the work permit. Allegations that Omotoso had been deported to South Africa from the United Kingdom back in 2000 due to alleged fraudulent documents were refuted by the defence while submitting responding affidavits. The bail application continues today. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
