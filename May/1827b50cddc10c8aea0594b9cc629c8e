Atul Gupta Picture: KEVIN SUTHERLAND ANC MPs are losing patience with the Gupta family s influence in procurement deals of state-owned companies and are considering summoning the brothers to parliament. This was proposed by ANC MP Zukile Luyenge at a meeting between the parliamentary oversight committee on public enterprises and state-owned arms manufacturer Denel yesterday. The meeting was to discuss Denel s disciplinary action against three of its former top executives chief executive Riaaz Salooje financial officer Michael Mhlotho and secretary Elizabeth Africa. They have since left the company after refusing to follow board instructions to facilitate joint ventures with Gupta-linked firms Denel Asia and VR Laser SA. President Jacob Zuma s son Duduzane Zuma has a stake in VR laser. Luyenge said: Let s call these Guptas to tell us how they came to provide services at [this] level.
