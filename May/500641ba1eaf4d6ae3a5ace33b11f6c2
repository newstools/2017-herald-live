A suspect was arrested just hours after a dramatic armed robbery and hijacking in Kwazakhele on Friday afternoon. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said the incident happened at about 12pm when more than 10 suspects armed with various firearms overpowered and assaulted security guards escorting a distillers delivery truck making deliveries at Antandi Tavern in Matiwane Street. The suspects were using a white Quantum and blue BMW. The truck driver drove off to safety as the suspects opened fire on the guards. The suspects managed to rob the guards of a 5.56mm rifle and 9mm pistol and then took off with the white Toyota Hilux bakkie the guards were using, Beetge said. An hour later, Flying Squad members spotted the BMW in Qeqe Street and a 31-year-old who had a 9mm firearm in his possession &#8211; not the one that was stolen &#8211; was arrested. The hijacked Toyota bakkie was found abandoned in Adonisi Road at about 2pm. The suspect is expected to appear in the New Brighton Magistrate s Court on Monday on a charge of illegal possession of firearm and will face other charges if he is linked to the robbery.
