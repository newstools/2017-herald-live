Zaloumis said shortly before Tanaka had surfaced unconscious the backup divers had entered the water to meet the deep divers at 70m in accordance with the standard ascend safety procedures for this kind of technical dive. He said the surface support boat team and surface divers immediately brought the unconscious diver onto the boat and tried to resuscitate him. He was then taken to Mseleni Hospital where he was pronounced dead. Tanaka a former specialist dive trainer for the military, had a passion for nature and was fascinated by the creatures he was filming.
