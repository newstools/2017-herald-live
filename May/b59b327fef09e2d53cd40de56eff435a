Elvis Ramosebudi, a man who allegedly plotted to assassinate officials perceived as state capture beneficiaries made his first appearance in the Johannesburg Magistrate s Court Picture: ALON SKUY/ THE TIMES The state will be opposing bail in the case of the alleged hitman Elvis Ramosebudi on Friday. Ramosebudi is charged with two counts of incitement to violence. Ramosebudi is accused of sending a letter in October to Anglo American asking the company for money to help his efforts to murder high-profile government officials. These included President Jacob Zuma mining minister Mosebenzi Zwane and ex-deputy finance minister Mcebisi Jonas. He allegedly wanted to target people who benefited from &#8220;state capture&#8221;. The state had initially charged Ramosebudi with conspiracy to commit murder which would have required that he had roped in at least one other person. However the state dropped this charge on Tuesday and said he had acted alone. The National Prosecuting Authority also says it does not have evidence that he is a coup plotter. This is a step down from initial statements that Ramosebudi had plotted to overthrow the government. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
