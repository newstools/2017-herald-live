The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality has warned high water users in the city to cut back on consumption and fix water leaks on their properties. The municipality says, it found through its budget and treasury department that domestic customers were wasting water despite the city facing a crisis. Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said the city would be visiting the houses of those wasting water. The municipality is currently visiting these high consumers to establish the reasons for the high consumption, whether there are any leaks on the properties. Those that have been identified [and] failed to comply will be issued with notices immediately. The expectation is that all domestic water consumers must use less than 40kl/month, Mniki said. As a last resort, the municipality will install water demand management devices that will automatically cut their water when they reach 40kl within a month. He said the city would be issuing 313 notices to customers altogether. The city s dam levels are currently at a combined 40.24% level as at Monday.
