Alton de Lange, left, Lora Joplin and Rochey Walters were at Joplin&#8217;s single launch last Friday at Cafe Capellini in Newton Park Hello darlings, it is me again you re favourite Skinnerbek, here to bring you all the juiciest bits from the Bay social scene. Last Friday I went to check out Bloemendal artist Lora Joplin at Cafe Capellini in Newton Park. Joplin was launching her single called Forbidden Fruit and I must say I was more than pleasantly surprised at how good and polished she sounded. Rochey Walters from San Entertainment, where Joplin is signed to, looked chuffed with himself while mingling with fans. He laughed the night away and was more than generous with the champagne. One half of The Stone Sisters, Shan-Lee Stone, was also in attendance with her manager father, Ashley. The conference room at the venue was a bit cramped as it felt like people were standing on top of each other, but other than that it was a hit. Earlier this week, on Tuesday to be exact, I went out to Shag High Voltage Hair in South End to check out Lucy Kruger &amp; The Lost Boys album. It wasn t my usual crowd and everyone else looked cooler than me, but I managed to get through it. I was blown away when the band started singing and Lucy began her set. Everyone sounded so good and she looked super-hot. I spotted Rod and Sherry from Stampede Cruises who looked very cosy by one of the candle-lit tables. But I was the only one who did not get the memo about food and drink. I had no money on me and kept seeing people walking in with bottles of wine and six-packs. I went home hungry and thirsty, and feeling more than a little sorry for myself. Note to self: If you re waltzing off to a do it s always best to read all the information supplied because if I had done so, I d have known to take my own drinks. Ciao for now, darlings, let s catch up again next week! Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
