Strydom Wanbi of Chippa United during the Absa Premiership match between Free State Stars and Chippa United Picture: Charl Lombard / Gallo Images Chippa United survived to fight another season in the Premier Soccer League when they played to a goalless draw against Free State Stars in Bethlehem on Saturday. The Chilli Boys needed just one point from their final fixture on Saturday and the team managed to do just that with their fighting draw. It was a fitting present for their coach Dan Malesela who celebrated his 52nd birthday on Saturday. Malesela says he has yet to ascertain from management whether he will remain at the club for next season but said this week he had already started recruiting new players. The result will come as a huge boost to the metro as top flight will return to the Bay for the 2017/18 season. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
