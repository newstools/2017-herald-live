Community members outside the Goodwood Magistrate s Court where Courtney Pieters&#8217; alleged killer is expected to appear Picture: Esa Alexander WE WANT ANSWERS. That s the message on one of the posters brandished by angry residents from Elsies River waiting for murder accused Mortimer Saunders to appear at the Goodwood Magistrate s Court on Wednesday. Saunders stands accused of raping and killing three-year-old Courtney Pieters earlier this month. Saunders on Wednesday appeared calm in the dock dressed in a blue t-shirt and black jacket. The case was postponed to August 24 for further investigation. Not only was Saunders a tenant at the Pieters family s modest Cape Flats home he was also her father s best friend according to family spokesperson Roegchanda Pascoe. Little Courtney s story has shocked the nation and prompted a visit to the family by President Jacob Zuma last week. Zuma said it was one of the saddest things he had ever heard. That a man who stays here can rape the child kill the child in the bedroom &#8230; and break every bone to make the child fit in a plastic bag &#8230; It shows something has gone wrong with society he said. About 200 people from the community gathered outside the court on a chilly Wednesday morning. Police had to block the entrance to the courtroom where Courtney s visibly distraught parents Juanita Pieters and Aron Fourie took a seat. More than 10 police officers were deployed to the court room. &#8211; TMG Digital/TimesLIVE Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
