Lora Joplin Picture: Jozayne Crouse Photography Having started singing at the age of five, a Bloemendal vocalist has released her first official single, Forbidden Fruit. Lora Joplin, 27, first performed on stage when she sang with the help of her father at her church when she was just five years old, and has never looked back. While she has never been signed under any record label and has only ever recorded and performed what she modestly refers to as just diary entries written by her friend, Joplin wowed the crowd when she performed at the Local is Lekker concert hosted by SAN Entertainment at the PE Opera House last weekend. This just over two weeks after she signed with the record label. When they were promoting the Local is Lekker show on Facebook, a friend of mine commented that I was the only person missing on their lineup. From there, they asked for my profile [and the rest was history], she said. The RnB Soul vocalist has scooped a number of awards including the best female vocalist in the Bay Area Music Awards in 2013. Joplin said most of her music was inspired by her personal experiences and Forbidden Fruit is no different. Forbidden Fruit was inspired by a personal experience. You know when you want [to be with] someone and the feeling is mutual but there is an obstacle standing in the way. Alton de Lange of SAN Entertainment said they were inspired by Joplin s raw talent and untainted personality to sign her. We could see that all she needed were some resources to give her the break she needed in life. She can be a huge inspiration to other talented individuals who [are] hooked on substance, he said. De Lange expressed excitement about Joplin s future, saying he saw no reason why her music could not go mainstream. Forbidden Fruit is available on iTunes, Google Play and other digital music stores.
