Not all parents are aware of profiling their children. That is why we as an organisation recommend it because then parents have all the information should there be an emergency situation Missing Children South Africa national case officer Bianca van Aswegen said. According to Missing Children South Africa 181 children were reported missing from May last year to April 30 this year. Of those 145 children were found.

Identity kits usually contain the child s weight height fingerprints hair and eye colour descriptions of scars and piercings and a recent photograph. The My Little Fingerprints project is growing popular since volunteer organisation The Pink Ladies were given the go-ahead in conjunction with police and community policing forums to publicly advise parents to fingerprint their children. Pink Ladies co-director Jacqui Thomas said the law did not allow the information to be stored in a database therefore the form was kept by parents. This information is extremely useful if or when a child is reported missing as information is all in the same place and immediately accessible. It saves precious time Thomas said. -TMG Digital/TimesLIVE Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
