South African drivers attitudes towards the law and each other are deteriorating a recent study has found. The Automobile Association (AA) survey found that about 90% of motorists believed compliance with the laws of the road had worsened over the past two years and 75% believed the attitude of motorists towards one another had deteriorated. About 1 000 people participated in the survey held last month. Across the country results showed 88% of motorists believed adherence to the rules of the road had worsened since 2015. This survey again highlights that too many drivers believe road traffic laws don t apply to them which when combined with what is perceived to be lower police visibility is perhaps part of the reason for our country s high road fatality statistics the AA said. Unless driver attitudes improve in addition to more effective policing the carnage on South African roads will continue unabated.
