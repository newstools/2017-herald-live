MP Makhosi Khoza File picture: Ruvan Boshoff Parliament&#8217;s presiding officers Baleka Mbete and Thandi Modise will meet to discuss the death threats against ANC MP Dr Makhosi Khoza. Khoza has spoken out after receiving several death threats and calls to resign following a Facebook post she wrote last month in which she criticised the morality of the ANC leadership. The post urged the ANC leadership to listen to the concerns expressed by the public about the state of the ruling party. Over the past few weeks, the ANC Youth League has called for her axing and threatened to picket outside her Durban home. Khoza, who said she fears for her children s lives, had her address circulated on social media, but the youth league denied any involvement in this. Parliament spokesman Moloto Mothapo said yesterday that Speaker Mbete would meet Modise to discuss the matter. This is not the first time Khoza, who became a well-known public face after chairing the committee tasked with finding the new public protector, has received threats. She also received threats earlier this year after an oversight visit to an Mpumalanga hospital with the public service and administration committee, which she chairs. Khoza, a former United Democratic Front member, had her house burnt down in the 1980s and was arrested for her activism. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
