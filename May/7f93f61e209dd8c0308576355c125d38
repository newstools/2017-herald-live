Unathi Msengana Picture: supplied Unathi Msengana has opened up about her journey to become a traditional healer and has admitted she knows it is something her ancestors have called on her to do. Speaking to Gareth Cliff on CliffCentral Unathi said she had always felt a close connection to her ancestors and revealed that the feeling had become stronger over the last few years. This strong sense of duty has led to the Idols SA judge travelling home to the Eastern Cape at least twice a year to perform traditional rituals. There s a spiritual calling there. I have already become more traditional. It is in the universe I have already become more aware of the journey that I have to take she said. She revealed that her ancestors have been calling her and she could not run from her calling. I have had to accept more responsibilities spiritually and that is part of the journey. It is a beautiful journey and one that I have to embark on. They [the ancestors] have been calling and I know the responsibilities. It is a journey that gets deeper and stronger as I get older she said. However Unathi believed that she will only be called upon to fulfill her calling once her children are older. I know that my calling will only fully develop in my third phase of womanhood she added. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
