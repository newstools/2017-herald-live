Police Minister Fikile Mbalula has noted with concern a spate of reports about missing people especially women and children. This follows the news yesterday that Karabo Mokoena, who had been missing since April 28, had been found dead. A 27-year-old man was arrested yesterday at his home in Sandton in connection with her death. I have been receiving complaints from the public on social media and at my office regarding missing young women and children, Mbalula said. This is a matter of grave concern to me and requires immediate action and attention. If people are to judge the South African Police Service it would be based on how it protects women and children, the most vulnerable persons in society. SAPS Missing Person Bureau must enhance its efforts in finding missing persons. Mbalula said there was no waiting period for reporting missing persons. When you suspect your loved one is missing immediately report [it] to your nearest police station with their most recent photograph, he said. An investigator will be allocated to your case and an investigation to find the person will immediately kick-start. Mbalula said there should never be no-go zones and that the SAPS would enhance its visibility in areas considered risky. Some people on Twitter were not too pleased that the police ministry had only now assured the public that cases of missing people would be treated with the utmost importance. Among these were Zintle Craig who said: We ve been retweeting missing woman for the past two weeks, now the death of Karabo has woken you guys up. Please don t fail us.
