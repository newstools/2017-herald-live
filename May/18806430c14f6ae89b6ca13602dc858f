A Dutch spy chief has warned of a possible &#8216;serious case of digital sabotage&#8217; Stock picture: iStock The world may be close to a &#8220;serious act of digital sabotage&#8221; which could trigger unrest, &#8220;chaos and disorder,&#8221; Dutch spy chief Rob Bertholee warned Tuesday. Sabotage of critical infrastructure &#8220;is the kind of thing that might keep you awake at night,&#8221; Bertholee told a timely cyber security conference in The Hague, as global experts grapple with the fallout of a massive cyber attack over the past days. Digital threats &#8220;are not imaginary, they are everywhere around us,&#8221; the head of the country&#8217;s intelligence services (AIVD) told the conference organised by the Dutch government. &#8220;In my opinion, we might be closer to a serious act of digital sabotage than a lot of people can imagine,&#8221; he told hundreds of experts and officials. Bertholee highlighted how in 2012 the computers at Saudi Arabia&#8217;s largest oil company came under brief attack, or how three years later Ukrainian electricity companies were hacked causing a massive blackout lasting several hours. The world&#8217;s infrastructure was heavily interconnected, which had huge benefits, but also &#8220;vulnerabilities&#8221;. &#8220;Imagine what would happen if the entire banking system were sabotaged for a day, two days, for a week,&#8221; he asked. &#8220;Or if there was a breakdown in our transportation network. Or if air traffic controllers faced cyber attacks while directing flights. The consequences could be catastrophic.&#8221; Added Bertholee: &#8220;Sabotage on one of these sectors could have major public repercussions, causing unrest, chaos and disorder.&#8221; The threat of &#8220;cyber terrorism&#8221; from terror groups such as the so-called Islamic State jihadist and Al-Qaeda was still limited, he said, but &#8220;jihadist-inspired terrorism is the number one priority&#8221; of the Dutch intelligence services. &#8220;The level of technical expertise available to a jihadist group is still insufficient to inflict significant damage or personal injury through digital sabotage,&#8221; Bertholee said. &#8220;They may not yet have the capability but they definitely have the intent.&#8221; Countries must be prepared for future threats in the digital domain, with governments and private sector working closely together, as this is &#8220;where our societies have become most vulnerable,&#8221; he said. Security researchers investigating the massive cyber attack campaign over past days on Tuesday reported signs that it might be slowing, and suggested a possible North Korean link. In the first clues of the origin of the massive ransomware attacks, Google researcher Neel Mehta posted computer code that showed similarities between the &#8220;WannaCry&#8221; malware and a vast hacking effort widely attributed to Pyongyang. Europol meanwhile said the number of affected IP addresses around the world was 163 745 a 38% fall from the 226 000 reported on Sunday.
