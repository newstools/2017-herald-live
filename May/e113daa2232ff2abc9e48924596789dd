Robertson s Spices offers this simple yet tasy autumn soup its spin on the old South African favourite of butternut soup. It serves four and is delicious with toasted ciabatta bread. Ingredients 1 kg butternut peeled &amp; chopped Salt and black pepper to taste 15 ml margarine 2 medium onions roughly chopped 2 cloves garlic roughly chopped 5 ml nutmeg 1.25 ml peri peri 1 litre water 1 chicken stock cube 250 ml cream Method In a large pot, melt the margarine and fry the onions, garlic, Nutmeg and Peri-Peri until just soft. Add the butternut, water and chicken stock cube and bring to the boil. Allow to simmer for about 30 minutes or until the butternut is soft. Remove from heat and blend with a stick blender or food processor until smooth. Stir in the cream and season to taste with salt and pepper. Tip: don t discard your pumpkin or butternut seeds when preparing pumpkin or butternut. Rather keep them aside, wash under running water to remove any clinging squash then spice them, drizzle with a little bit of olive oil and roast in the oven at a low heat for about 15 minutes. Use the roasted seeds to garnish a salad or any dish that contains pumpkin or butternut. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
