Britain&#8217;s Princess Charlotte Picture: via Reuters She is one of the most privileged toddlers on earth, with grandparents who run a children s party business with enough princess-themed decoration to cover Kensington Palace. But Princess Charlotte s second birthday party today will be a low-key affair. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are likely to host a small family party at their Norfolk home for the toddler, who has been photographed in public only a handful of times, most recently on Christmas Day. Her parents and Prince Harry all have the day off from official royal engagements. Prince George s second birthday was marked with the release of photographs by Mario Testino, and a birthday party at Anmer Hall, while Princess Charlotte s first birthday saw photographs taken by her mother released. The birthday is the start of a busy month for the Middleton family, with Pippa, the Duchess of Cambridge s sister, to marry James Matthews on May 20 at St Mark s Church in Englefield, Berkshire. Princess Charlotte will take a starring role in the wedding, as a bridesmaid, while her brother is a pageboy. The Middleton-Matthews wedding celebrations are at risk of being overshadowed, as all eyes fix on Prince Harry and his girlfriend, Meghan Markle. Markle, an American actress, was previously thought to have been omitted from the guest list, but has the week surrounding the wedding off work thanks to a break in the filming schedule of US drama Suits.
