This was part of a national groundswell of opinion against the ongoing violence against women in South Africa. The first placard had the disclaimer When we say #MenAreTrash we don t mean them all . Which was apt, as menswear designer and man Dalton Smit led the charge with a gender-somersault collection targeted squarely at summer bodies. Boxy tops, cute shorts, rompers and pyjama-esque suits in light fabrics with in loose silhouettes were aimed at comfort. Peppermint stripes, pastel pink and baby blue were among the colours Smit predicts for the warmer months, along with an intriguing crochet-inspired playsuit. Thami Phungulwa presented a small yet chic look with her Garments of Praise label, shimmering in gold and black stretch fabrics. The capsule collection of four outfits captured the dress code of the afternoon which was bold and black . Lisokazi Manzini then pushed pink to the front with a girly twist. Her final number of a mini-cape or was it a cloak? embellished with a giant fuschia bow put a gold seal on an extremely happy and wearable collection. The Kwantu line-up by Kule Matana gave casual summer T-shirts an equal billing with winter jackets and vests in plaid and blanket fabrics. Established talent Cleo Allison showcased a totally new look and palette, with bottle green and black giving the nod to cooler months. She also opted for tactile velour and body-hugging tops, paired with skirts with fluid lines. Bold black and white stripes hugged the body with just a touch of softness. Jo-Anne Moses presented a range that included wear for children, called Jobs Creation. The final collection was Ati Setipa s Ati Designs, another pop of colour for the chilly Sunday afternoon. The organisers of Bay Fashion Sunday have decided to call it a day after three successful events the first two at the Roof Garden Bar, the third at WERK to focus on the main production of the second Nelson Mandela Bay Fashion Week in October.
