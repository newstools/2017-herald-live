NEW CHALLENGE: Man Kaur, who is 101, walks along the SkyWalk of the Auckland Sky Tower in New Zealand Picture:GETTY IMAGES The oldest athlete at the World Masters Games has become the oldest person to walk along the top of Auckland s Sky Tower. Man Kaur, 101, an Indian athlete and the oldest competitor at the World Masters Games held in the city last month, stepped out onto a platform 192m above Auckland and walked across it holding the hand of her son Gurdev Singh, 79. She is the oldest person to complete the SkyWalk in Auckland and is living proof that age or any other number of excuses people come up with are not a good enough reasons to stop taking on challenges, setting new goals and living life to the fullest. Kaur said afterwards she thought everyone should do this and spoke of her desire for more people from India to visit New Zealand. It is very different here with no pollution and such clear air. There s so few people and cars, compared to what we are used to, she said. Kaur, a vegetarian, finished her visit to Skycity with pumpkin soup, fresh vegetables, risotto and summer berries at SkyCity s revolving restaurant Orbit 360. She credits her good health to healthy food and regular exercise, running every second day and working at a gym on her upper body. Last week, Kaur won both the 100m and 200m sprints in her age category at the World Masters Games, making her the oldest to join a select group of athletes who have managed to win in both categories at a single international sporting event.
