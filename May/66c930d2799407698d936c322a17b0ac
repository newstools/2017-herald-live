Victoria Park High School presents the timeless tale of King Arthur and the knights of the Round Table in the famous Lerner and Loewe musical Camelot this week. The musical opens tonight at the Blake Hall at the school and will be staged at 7pm each night until Saturday, May 20. There is an additional matinee on Saturday at 2pm. The legend of Camelot follows Arthur, from a young ambitious, idealistic king who dreams of creating a just society to a king bearing witness to this dream s demise. When his beloved wife Guenevere falls in love with Arthur s most celebrated and loyal knight Lancelot, everything begins to unravel. The troubles are intensified when Arthur s illegitimate son Mordred sets out to destroy Arthur and his dream. The musical incorporates memorable numbers such as the theme song Camelot, The Simple Joys of Maidenhood, The Lusty Month of May, How to Handle a Woman, If Ever I Would Leave You, and many others. Directed by Mariette van der Walt with musical director Marlon Louis, vocal director Liske Potgieter and choreographer Catherine Gouws, the school says Camelot is definitely a show not to be missed. Tickets are R70 for adults and R50 for scholars and pensioners, and there is a special block booking price of R40 offered to groups of 20 or more. Further information from the school, (041) 508-6400.
