MIGHTY MEN: Armand Struwig and paraplegic Daniel Theron were part of the group that walked to Middleburg Picture: BRIAN WITBOOI Twelve men carried a 15kg cross for more than 370km when they walked from Port Elizabeth to Middelburg to show their love for Jesus Christ. The men left Port Elizabeth for Middelburg on April 22 to attend the Karoo Mighty Men Conference on April 28 at the Rusoord Farm in the Karoo. They arrived back in Port Elizabeth on Sunday after being offered a lift. Armand Struwig, 29, of Sherwood, organised the walk to spread the message of God. This was a walk of faith. We did not have money, food or shelter but along the way God provided, Struwig said. Sometimes they stayed in guesthouses and a pastor in Jansenville opened his house to them. Motorists would stop and offer us food, cold drinks, money and accommodation, he said. The men suffered numerous blisters on their feet while covering an average of 50km a day. Struwig said the group all came from diverse backgrounds but wanted to use the walk to spread the message of God. Wheelchair-bound Daniel Theron, 33, of Walmer, said while they had to contend with scorching temperatures in the Karoo, the journey had been an eye-opener. It was amazing. Being a paraplegic, the challenge for me was the heat, he said. Jason Campbell, 26, of Gelvandale, said it was the first time he had embarked on such an adventure. The walk was awesome, he said.
