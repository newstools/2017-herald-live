Three people were injured during an early morning fight between two taxi associations in Jeffreys Bay yesterday. Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said the incident took place at about 8.30am at the Oceanview taxi rank. Swart said the two groups were from rival taxi associations. Several shots were fired. Some of the alleged [assailants] had golf clubs and cricket bats with them as well. While no one had been shot when police officers arrived, three people had sustained injuries, she said. A 39-year-old was stabbed in the back, while a 35-year-old sustained a head injury, Swart said. The third victim was taken to hospital. A statement still needs to be taken from him. Two men, aged 26 and 45, were arrested and charged with attempted murder and assault with grievous bodily harm. An investigation into the incident was still under way.
