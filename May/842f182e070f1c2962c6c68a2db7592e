A Port Elizabeth man has been hospitalised after he was stabbed three times during a late-night robbery at his beachfront house in Seaview. According to police, three attackers, one armed with an axe and another two with screwdrivers, entered the house through an open sliding door at the back of the house. Police said yesterday details were still sketchy as the injured man, Gavin Smith, 52, and his wife had been taken to hospital and had not yet given a detailed statement. The attack happened at about 11.20pm on Thursday, but police detectives and forensic experts only managed to get inside the home at first light yesterday. The upmarket house, in Elizabeth Street in Seaview, borders the rocky beach. Nitrous Security general manager Vicky Coetzee, 42, said his team had arrived at the house after Smith s wife managed to push the panic button during the attack. We arrived to find him [Coetzee] bleeding out in the bed. He had been stabbed in the chest and stomach with a screwdriver. The ambulance arrived very quickly and managed to stabilise him before rushing him and his wife to hospital. Coetzee said they had searched the area after the attack but the men had vanished. It was a very bloody scene and he was very lucky, he added. Police spokeswoman Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said the men had gained access through the sliding door. How they got around and into the garden is still being looked into. Once in the house, a scuffle ensued where he [Smith] was stabbed three times with a screwdriver. The suspects then fled on foot through the same door. The only things missing are two cellphones. Janse van Rensburg said the motive was suspected to be robbery. However, the incident was still under investigation. At this stage the motive remains robbery, she said. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
