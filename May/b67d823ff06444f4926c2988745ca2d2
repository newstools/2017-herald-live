A Port Elizabeth mother was shot dead inside her house as her young child hid in a nearby bedroom. Thabisa Ntoto, 37, was shot in the head and neck during a heated argument with two men inside her Mbilini Street, Kwazakhele, home shortly before 6pm on Thursday. Details remain sketchy as detectives are still attempting to piece the puzzle together. Ntoto s 10-year-old child survived after running to a bedroom to hide. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said yesterday the minor had been told to go to the bedroom by Ntoto seconds after the two men barged into the home. The men entered the house through the unlocked front door, Beetge said. An argument between the mother and the two men ensued. The woman was shot and the suspects fled. A silver Avanza parked outside was used as a getaway car. Beetge said nothing had been stolen. It is unknown who these men are and what their relationship to the deceased was, he said. All scenarios are being looked into. Asked if Ntoto had been a state witness in any case, Beetge said that would form part of the investigation. The Motherwell hit task team has taken over the case.
