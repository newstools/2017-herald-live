Hlaudi Motsoeneng s case in the Labour Court was dismissed yesterday afternoon and he was ordered to pay the costs. The controversial former chief operating officer of the SABC approached the Labour Court in an attempt to have his disciplinary hearing stopped and have the chairman of the disciplinary committee Nazeem Cassim recuse himself. Motsoeneng was charged with misconduct following a media conference he called last month in which he criticised the SABC s decision to scrap the 90% local music policy which he had implemented. During the media conference Motsoeneng took a swipe at interim board member Krish Naidoo whom he accused of selling out . Last week his legal team argued that the issue should rather be heard by the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration because comments he made should be considered protected public disclosure. Motsoeneng s team are due to file an affidavit stating his defence by next Wednesday and the matter is now expected to be argued next Friday.
