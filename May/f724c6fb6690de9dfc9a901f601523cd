Joost van der Westhuizen, Amor Vittone and their children Jordan and Kylie File picture: Amor Vittone / Facebook Amor Vittone has found herself in the middle of a will drama as Joost van der Westhuizen s brother has produced another will that may leave her with nothing but a TV. Amor s lawyer Sean Hefferman confirmed to TshisaLIVE that there was an uncertainty around Joost s estate. He also confirmed that the Master of the High Court refused to accept the will produced by Joost s brother because Joost did not sign it. There is a dispute into the validity of the will that has been submitted to the Master of Court [by Joost s brother]. We are also in the process of submitting the initial will which we are in possession off so it may be considered he said. Amor s legal counsel told TshisaLIVE that Joost s initial will states that everything in Joost s estate goes to Amor and the children. He also said that Amor was mainly worried about the welfare of her children and has a direct interest in what debts and assets Joost had. He added that he was also made aware that the new will leaves nothing but a TV or two to Amor. My client is just trying to ensure that her children will be alright. In the case that both the initial and the latest will are deemed invalid by the court then because my client was married in community of property Joost s estate will go to her and her children he said. Netwerk 24 reported that Joost s brother Pieter van der Westhuizen and his lawyer Ferdi Hartzenberg are moving to have Joost s latest will [which lacks Joost s signature but was signed by his lawyer] declared valid after the Master of the High Court refused to accept it. Joost died earlier this year after succumbing to a public battle against Motor Neurone Disease (MND) at age 45. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
