Two employees of a roadworthy centre in Uitenhage and a mechanic were arrested in a sting operation after they allegedly accepted bribes to issue roadworthy certificates to vehicle owners. Jackie Dissel, Nomaxabiso Luphondwana and Ruan van Tonder were released on R1 000 bail each in the Port Elizabeth Commercial Crimes Court, where the case was postponed to May 24 for them to obtain legal representation. According to the charge sheet, Dissel and Luphondwana were employed at V-Teq Roadworthy Centre, while Van Tonder was self-employed at RJ Auto Worx and RJ Body, with premises in Constitution Road and Durban Street. Dissel and Luphondwana s duties included assisting customers with the inspection of motor vehicles and, upon passing the inspection, the issuing of roadworthy certificates. The prosecution alleges that the three accused had operated as a syndicate to issue false certificates in exchange for cash, while the vehicles in question were either not roadworthy or had never even been tested. Between July and August 2015, all three accused allegedly accepted bribes of between R600 and R800 each from undercover Crime Intelligence officer Sergeant Thembinkosi Mpentse. In exchange, they issued certificates for unroadworthy vehicles Mpenstse had taken to the centre. The three face charges of corruption.
