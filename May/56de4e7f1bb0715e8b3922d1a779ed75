Chippa United coach Dan Malesela s future at the Premier Soccer League side appears uncertain, despite his having agreed to come back to the club . The former Orlando Pirates defender was placed on special leave by the club due to poor results, but was soon recalled in an attempt to avoid relegation. Malesela s return coincided with the Port Elizabethbased soccer team clinching their second win this year, after having gone 12 matches without victory. Chippa only need a point from their final game to survive the big drop. Malesela once said that he would stay with the team until 2019 but now admits that matters are not clearcut. Honestly speaking, even if contracts are in place I don t want to lie and say yes I ll be with Chippa until 2019, the coach said after their 3-0 win against SuperSport United on Wednesday night. Sometimes these things are not dependent on me. It s dependent on results. I didn t come here because I want to be a yoyo. I also came back because it pained me when I saw what was happening at the club. I thought this team had potential and I said: I am still on contract, let me go back and help if I can . So the circumstances of staying in the club or not are dependent on both the club and myself. Malesela said that although it was his wish to stay at the club and continue what he had started, his family would also have a say in the matter. I want to finish my contract. I am not too keen on changing clubs from time to time, particularly if there isn t anything to achieve than working for a salary, he said. If I am working to achieve things I want to stay longer. To build the club, build a legacy, build players and find a team that can win competitions cannot be done in one season. It will depend on how we handle things, what the club wants or what I want and if we agree on things. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
