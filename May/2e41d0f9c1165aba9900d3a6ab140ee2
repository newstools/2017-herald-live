Stanford Road, Helenvale #PEProtest pic.twitter.com/tIL8HRYqUE HeraldLIVE (@HeraldPE) May 11, 2017 Police are on high alert in Helenvale after unconfirmed reports that one person had been shot in the neck. A police nyala is driving up and down Stanford Road in front of Helenvale where residents have been protesting since early on Thursday. The road has been blocked from Gail Road to 3rd Avenue, with traffic being rerouted to get into the northern areas. Protesters who say they have had enough of empty promises by mayor Athol Trollip have been throwing stones, damaging some cars, and burning tyres. Shots were also fired earlier on Thursday. One woman, who refused to be identified, said: We are unemployed and have nothing. The mayor hasn t given us anything he promised. We want work and a decent area to live in but we have nothing. School children have also joined the protest. Police spokeswoman Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said she would issue a statement later. &nbsp; Onlookers keep an eye on the protests from a safe vantage point near Hillcrest Primary. #Helenvale #PEProtest pic.twitter.com/sdGp5ROUNd HeraldLIVE (@HeraldPE) May 11, 2017 Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
