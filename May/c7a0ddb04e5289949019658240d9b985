Having eased himself into action after an extended injury layoff against the Western Force Pat Lambie will be pressed into service as the starting flyhalf for the Sharks date with the Southern Kings in Port Elizabeth tomorrow. Due to Curwin Bosch s unexpected success Lambie was not missed but with the France test series just under a month away he is expected to play a key role while his Bulls contemporary, Handre Pollard, convalesces from his ankle injury. With the Sharks having lost just one game in Lambie s absence the 34-29 loss to the Lions on April Fool s Day the 26-year-old is raring to have a go at the Kings who nearly pulled his team s pants down on March 18. There have been some good weeks and not so good weeks, but all in all I ve been pleased with how the side has been tracking Lambie said. We had a really nice win against the Western Force and we were disappointed not to have secured the bonus point. At this stage we want to build some nice momentum before the June break because we ve got a few tough games ahead. If we can put in some good performances, we can put ourselves in a decent position ahead of the international window, Lambie said. He is one of four changes made by Sharks coach Robert du Preez, with the makeup of the starting 15 looking like a side that takes the Kings seriously. In the corresponding fixture, the Sharks won 19-17. Franco Marais Lwazi Mvovo and Tendai Mtawarira are the players who make their way back into the starting 15 after taking a break last week. The Kings are a really good side if you look at the individuals they have in that team, Du Preez said. They ve got some very good rugby players and Lionel Cronje has been playing very well. It s going to be really tough there but we re playing some good rugby and we re going down there to do a job and that s to bring back the four points, he said.
