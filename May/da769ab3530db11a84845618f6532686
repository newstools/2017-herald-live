Pupils at Colleen Glen Farm School. Picture: Brian Witbooi Eight Colleen Glen Farm School teachers are being kept hostage by a group of parents demanding scholar transport for their children. Seven female teachers and one male teacher have been locked in a room since 8am this morning. The parents accused the Department of Education of making false promises. Nomathamsanqa Mfengu, 40, said the parents were angered when the scholar transport failed to fetch their children on Monday. &#8220;The department made an undertaking that the transport will be available to fetch our children today but to our dismay, it did not pitch. As parents we then resolved to locking the teachers inside until the department comes and addresses this matter,&#8221; Mfengu said. Several school children standing outside the gate, carrying placards and singing struggle songs with their parents, have vowed not to move until their demands are met.
