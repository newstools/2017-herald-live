The two-day concert will feature music from a massed choir of 150 voices and the full Eastern Cape Philharmonic Orchestra, conducted by Richard Cock. Classical music enthusiasts are expected to flock to the centre for tomorrow s show at 5pm and for Sunday s show at 3pm. The much-loved concert, in aid of St Francis Hospice, has over the past 16 years seen its venues packed to capacity, with event organiser Melanie Manson saying only a few tickets were left for this weekend s event. The concert is in support of patients suffering from cancer, HIV/ Aids and Motor Neuron Disease. Acts to look forward to include soprano vocalist Cecilia Rangwanasha and flautist Tatiana Thaele. Rangwanasha was especially excited to work with Cock. I have never worked with him in this manner before even though I have seen him at festivals; I have always wanted to work with him because he is the best conductor. Our audience can expect magic as I have prepared Meine Lippen sie Kussen so Heiss by Franz Lehar. I will also be singing Hallelujah, the post-graduate vocal art student at UCT said, adding that the variations in the programme had caught her eye. I have never attended a show where the singer and instrumentalists are on stage at the same time and for me that is quite unique and beautiful, she said. &nbsp; Manson said: Port Elizabeth is a little bit culturally starved. There is a lot happening in other genres, such as pop and jazz, but if you are into the classics and operatic voices and really good dance, there has been very little of that in PE. Richard Cock is a very charismatic man, he teaches you about the music throughout the concert. It s a very special event. Tickets are R120 to R140.
