Two people were tormented inside their homes and robbed in separate incidents in Port Elizabeth early yesterday. The first incident happened shortly before 1am, when three men attacked a woman, 34, inside the Woodside Grove complex in Genadendal Road, Miramar. The woman was confronted by three men when she opened her back sliding door for her dog. As the woman opened the door, three men pushed her into the house at knife-point, police spokesman Warrant Officer Alwin Labans said. A struggle ensued and the woman was hit, but she managed to scream and press a panic button. The men grabbed small items, like a laptop and her handbag, before fleeing. The other robbery happened at 5am, when three men wearing balaclavas held up a man, 47, at gunpoint inside his home in China Street, Bethelsdorp. The man had woken to the sound of breaking glass. When he investigated, three men were inside the house. Two had firearms and threatened to shoot him, Labans said. The men grabbed a TV and cellphone and fled.
