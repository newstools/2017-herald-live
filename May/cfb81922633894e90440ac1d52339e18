Prospects for light at the end of the tunnel that has become naming South Africa s next coach receded yesterday when instead of taking a decision Cricket South Africa (CSA) passed the buck to a committee to help them make up their minds. The contract of South Africa s current coach Russell Domingo expires after South Africa s tour to England which is scheduled to end on August 8. Domingo told reporters on Saturday that he had not been informed of the process for filling the position. A CSA release yesterday said a panel consisting of their lead independent director Norman Arendse cricket administrators Rihan Richards and Oupa Nkagisang and former South Africa coaches Gary Kirsten and Eric Simons had been nominated to find a replacement. That is the latest twist in a saga that started on January 28. The last paragraph of a CSA release dealing with franchise and provincial developments said: The board of directors also resolved to commence the recruitment process for the appointment of the Proteas head coach to take charge after the tour to the UK until after the 2019 edition of the World Cup. What that release did not say was that as Domingo s contract had been extended three times sound corporate governance meant CSA had to either offer him a new deal or replace him. That neither has happened in almost four months is a distraction South Africa do not need as they bid to win a major trophy and beat England. If Domingo is not reappointed that could mean South Africa s new coach and their assistants will have 27 days to settle into their positions before the start of the test series against Bangladesh.
