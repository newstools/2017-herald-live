A Port Elizabeth man was shot and wounded after he allegedly pointed a toy gun at police officers in Motherwell at the weekend. The 35-year-old man, who is under police guard at Livingstone Hospital, is in a critical condition after being shot twice in the abdomen. The man allegedly failed to drop the toy gun after police first fired a warning shot. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said the incident happened at about 10.30pm on Sunday after a tip-off about a man walking in Ngonyama Street, carrying a firearm. Police responded and found the man walking in an open field next to Soqhayisa Senior Primary School. He was carrying a realistic-looking firearm in his hand. At the time, the firearm was thought to be real, he said. Several verbal warnings were given asking the man to throw the gun onto the ground, followed by a warning shot. The man failed to do so and pointed the firearm at the officers, prompting them to shoot. Even after the firearm was confiscated, it was thought to be real gun. There were three rounds of live ammunition inside the firearm. Only after forensic experts arrived to collect the firearm, was it found to be a toy gun. Police suspect the man was drunk at the time. Once he is discharged from hospital, he will be charged in the Motherwell Magistrate s Court. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
