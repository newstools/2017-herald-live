The St George&#8217;s Club celebrated its 150th anniversary last year The Port Elizabeth St George s Club celebrated its 150th anniversary last year and produced a glossy commemorative coffee table book to mark the achievement. It is our understanding that this makes the club the oldest club of this type in South Africa, St George s Club manager Kobus Gerber says. He said although the book initially was only available to members of the club, as well as other interested parties, the club had a few extra copies that it would like to publicise to residents of the city. The book retails for R220 and is on sale at Fogarty s Bookshop at Walmer Park Shopping Centre.
