The Pick n Pay in Summerstrand Village was robbed on Tuesday The Pick n Pay in Summerstrand Village was robbed by five men who entered the shop through a loading bay yesterday morning. According to police, two of the robbers were armed with 9mm pistols. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Alwin Labans said a security guard at the loading bay behind the shop was held up at gunpoint. The men entered the loading bay by posing as workers to assist with off-loading a truck, he said. As the robbers neared the back entrance to the shop, they held the security guard at gunpoint and forced him to escort them to the office. During the robbery, one of the suspects fired a shot into the ground and the bullet ricocheted and grazed a Pick n Pay employee. Labans said the robbers attempted to disable the CCTV camera system while forcing employees to open the safe. An undisclosed amount of money was taken. The robbers fled in a green VW Passat which was parked nearby. The robbery comes only a day after a gang of nine robbers was involved in a shootout with cash-intransit guards at the Boxer Superstore in Commercial Road. About six hours earlier , a gang of nine also robbed the SUPERSPAR in Peddie and had a shootout with police. In both cases, the gang fled empty-handed.
