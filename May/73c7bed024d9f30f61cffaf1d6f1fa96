Lubabalo Jack shows off his traditional neckpiece Picture: Fredlin Adriaan A disciplinary hearing against a Port Elizabeth man who refused to remove a traditional necklace meant to bring him good fortune, was postponed to tomorrow. Lubabalo Jack, 35, was due to hear his fate yesterday but said he received a call from his company postponing the matter. He was suspended from Formex Engineering on Wednesday when he refused to remove the necklace, known as Intambo Enkulu. Jack, a laser technician supervisor, claims the company discriminated against him by preventing him from exercising his constitutional rights at work. He said Formex Engineering managing director Hennie Venter took him to task over the necklace and said he looked like a lion. Venter did not respond to telephone calls and messages yesterday.
