Co-organiser Tayla Foong said the event would move indoors for winter to keep the festive spirit alive during the colder months of the year. Twenty artisanal food trucks, tuk-tuks and trailers will find a new home inside the WERK_ warehouses and will incorporate the newly developed Chicky s Yard venue. We are very grateful to all our tenants for their collaboration and sense of valley ubuntu , Paola Cicognini-Horak of Paterson Road Investments said. By inviting the public into the yard and warehouses they have brought a sense of community, fun and vibrancy to this old industrial building, developing it into an interesting, welcoming and industrious space. Foong said: We intend to embrace the rawness of the structure and have reformatted the event to enhance interest and weatherproof the festival. Local traders produce everything from gourmet burgers, Halaal cuisine and thin-crust pizzas to Mexican tacos, Japanese bao buns and vegetarian options. Baakens Food Truck Friday supports local talent and the new layout has allowed for two stages to be included. Visitors can look forward to performances by Clique Claq, Black Tye, Abo Ngalonkulu, Jaykay, Joash, Subtrakshun and Kairuz. The Richmond Hill Brewing Company, Fratelli Foods, Benn Koppen and Brickmaker s Distilling Company will also trade at the event, providing beverage facilities and tastings. Entrance is free and all meals are capped at R45. The event runs until 9pm.
