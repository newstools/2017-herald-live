Water supply could be disrupted in parts of Nelson Mandela Bay today due to upgrade work being carried out by the municipality at the Nooitgedacht Water Treatment Works. Areas that could be affected by the disruptions during the 24-hour shutdown are Despatch, KwaDwesi, KwaMagxaki, Joe Slovo, Bethelsdorp, Bloemendal, Chatty, Coega, Motherwell, Wells Estate, Bluewater Bay, Colchester and parts of Uitenhage. Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki urged residents in the affected areas to use water sparingly as this could assist in minimising supply disruptions.
