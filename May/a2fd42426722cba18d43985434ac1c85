The temporary canal supplying water to the Nooitgedacht water treatment facility was completed last night, restoring the supply that feeds parts of Nelson Mandela Bay. Fanus Terblanche, contracts manager for Aquila Plant Hire and Civils, said the canal was reopened around 7pm on Wednesday. &#8220;By this morning water was already flowing through to Addo,&#8221; he said. This comes exactly one week after the canal was destroyed in a landslide. It is still unclear when Nooitgedacht will be ready to resume its supply to the Metro.
