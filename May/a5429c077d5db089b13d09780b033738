Nelson Mandela Bay mayoral committee member Nqaba Bhanga was announced the new leader to take over from former leader Athol Trollip. Bhanga, however, missed the announcement as officials struggled to track him down. Bhanga was supposed to address the delegates at the East London ICC where the provincial congress is being held.
