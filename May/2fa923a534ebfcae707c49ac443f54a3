#vanbreda welcome back to the triple axe murder trial. Henri is assisting with setting up speakers for emergency telephone call. @TimesLIVE pic.twitter.com/MyLX6Ip2LT Anthony Molyneaux (@AJGMolyneaux) May 17, 2017 Henri van Breda helped court staff to set up speakers on Wednesday so his triple-murder trial could hear the emergency call he made. Van Breda called ambulance dispatcher Janine Philander around 7.30am on January 27 2015 several hours after his parents Martin and Teresa and his elder brother Rudi were killed. He is also accused of attempting to murder his sister Marli. Tuesday s court proceedings were adjourned when there were problems with the sound system in court. But on Wednesday Van Breda helped to ensure that the 20-minute call could be heard clearly by Judge Siraj Desai who is presiding over his trial in the High Court in Cape Town. Philander told Desai on Tuesday that Van Breda s behaviour when he spoke to her was so atypical of a witness to murder that she was convinced it was a prank call. He was a bit hesitant and made a sound like a giggle and I thought it was a prank she said. The normal reaction for a home invasion and assault of this nature is that people are frantic shouting screaming in tears &#8230; He wasn t anxious or agitated or any other such thing. He was just cool and calm. -TMG Digital/TimesLIVE Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
