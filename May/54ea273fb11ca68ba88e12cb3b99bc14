Former DA leader Helen Zille has dismissed an assertion that she has gone rogue saying that recent articles written by her were cleared by party leader Mmusi Maimane. However, Maimane has denied her claims, saying that Zille wrote in her own capacity and not in the name of the DA. Yesterday, Western Cape premier Zille tweeted that articles she had written which appeared in the Sunday Times and on the Daily Maverick website last week had gone to Maimane s office for vetting. For the record, I submitted last week s STimes and DMaverick articles to @MmusiMaimane s office for vetting before publication. What rogue? Zille said. She was responding to Business Day and Financial Mail editor-in-chief Peter Bruce who wrote in his column in the Sunday Times that Zille had gone rogue and would write and say what she wants now that she s been charged by the party . DA spokesman Mabine Seabe said he was not aware of the articles going through our office and referred questions to party chief Jordan Hill Lewis who said: The official party line is that there is no comment. There is an ongoing disciplinary process taking place and we would like to keep it inside that process. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
