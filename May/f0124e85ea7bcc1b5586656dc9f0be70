Section 204 witness Luthando Siyoni Picture: Brian Witbooi Section 204 witness, Luthando Siyoni, sat at a coffee shop near the Port Elizabeth High Court on Friday morning while his younger brother testified about the injuries he sustained during an alleged assault by the police. Siyanda told the court that when he saw Siyoni after his arrest in April 2015, he had a bruised and swollen face. He was also holding up his jeans as if they were about to fall off. Siyoni, who initially claimed he was hired by Christopher Panayiotou, 30, to find hitmen to kidnap and kill his wife, Jayde, 29, was declared a hostile witness when he recanted on his statement to allege the police beat him and forced him to implicate his former boss. Proceedings in the trial-within-a-trial, called to test the admissibility of a sting video in which Panayiotou allegedly implicated himself, came to an end on Friday. The state and defence were told to submit their heads of argument to Judge Dayalin Chetty by the end of the month so that he can be ready to hand down judgment when the matter resumes on June 12.
