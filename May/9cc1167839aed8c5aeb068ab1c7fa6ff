Making mom something special for breakfast on Sunday Mother s Day is a sure way to let her know you are thinking of her. Try this recipe for home-made flapjacks, and add a creative touch by piping the batter into the shape of a word or even a heart. Preparation time is around 15 minutes, and it will take roughly five minutes per batch to cook. The recipe makes four servings. Ingredients 1 cups self-rising flour cup milk 2 eggs cup sugar 1 tsp vanilla essence 1 pinch of salt teaspoon ground cinnamon Method Using a hand or electric beater, beat the eggs and milk together until fluffy. Mix in the flour, a pint of salt, sugar, cinnamon and vanilla essence. Mix together until you have a smooth batter. Let the batter rest for 30 minutes if you have the time, as it will cook more evenly. However, this step is not essential. Heat a pan on medium, and spray the pan with non-stick or melt a dab of butter. Pour your batter into an icing bag, and cut off a tiny hole at the end. It really must be a small hole or it will not make a thin enough stream to create the lettering. And this is how you add the love: carefully pipe in the pan a letter at a time, starting with the alphabet I , flip over when cooked and repeat the process for the words you want to say to mum.
