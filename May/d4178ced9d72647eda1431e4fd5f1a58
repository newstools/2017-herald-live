More than 1 900 Nelson Mandela Bay residents will soon receive the keys to their new homes as the municipality s human settlements directorate prepares to start handing over newly approved title deeds. Yesterday, mayoral committee member for human settlements Nqaba Bhanga said the details of the handover would be communicated to the affected communities soon. The metro can today [yesterday] announce that 1 940 title deeds have been approved for handover to homeowners, some of whom have been waiting for over eight years, Bhanga said. This will directly change the lives of over 8 000 residents, from Helenvale to Veeplaas, and from Malabar to Chris Hani. He said home ownership was the first step toward turning the tide on poverty and undoing the effects of spatial segregation under apartheid. Between 2013 and 2015, under former administrations, not a single title deed was handed out in this metro. This new government appreciates the important role home ownership plays, thus we have embarked on an operation to clean up the housing list and ensure all rightful home owners are in possession of title deeds, Bhanga said.
