South African citizens are mocking police members because of their fitness levels Deputy Police Minister Bongani Mkongi told members of the SA Police Service (SAPS) in East London yesterday. The nation is mocking you because of your fitness levels Mkongi told about 150 members of the police force. Mkongi is on a five-day visit to the Eastern Cape which ends tomorrow to engage with communities and to check on aspects that need the ministry s urgent attention. Tackling obesity in the SAPS was high on the list of issues to be addressed he said. The deputy minister said the fitness of police members was very important if they wanted to win the battle against criminals. Mkongi said the country faced high levels of lawlessness, because criminals were undermining the police s physical capabilities. You are dealing with very sophisticated and heavily armed criminals running amok so it is important to defend yourself and the nation well he said. We [the police ministry] are here to look after you as SAPS members. We must make sure that you are equal to the task and you are not obese and are fit enough to chase those criminals.
