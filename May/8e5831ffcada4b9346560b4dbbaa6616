Southern Kings supporters are hoping to #FillTheStadium when the home team takes on The Sharks at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium this weekend File picture: Eugene Coetzee Passionate Southern Kings supporter Renaldo Gouws has launched a Facebook campaign to drum up support for the team s next home fixture against the Sharks at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday next week. The #FillTheStadium drive was launched on Sunday and has attracted keen interest. Gouws and the Kings are pushing for a sizeable crowd as the Eastern Cape franchise targets a third consecutive Super Rugby victory and their first over a South African team. Gouws said he started the initiative because the Southern Kings players and team management had shown they were giving it their all. The way they have been playing against teams with far bigger budgets and established talent pools shows us how proud we can be of our boys, he said. The Rebels victory was bittersweet bitter because the stadium was empty, but sweet because they showed the character of Eastern Cape Rugby. Filling the stadium would show that the Kings had support and their efforts had not gone unnoticed, Gouws said. Irrespective of what Saru decides about the team s future in Super Rugby, we are behind them. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
