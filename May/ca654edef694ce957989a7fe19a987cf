Humansdorp police have condemned the violent acts by community members following the murder of a woman in Patensie on Sunday morning. Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said Monique du Plooy and her boyfriend, both 30, were on their way to a Rooikloof Street, Ramaphosa Village house in Patensie at about 2am on Sunday when the two allegedly had an argument. The man allegedly stabbed du Plooy and she died on the scene. He was later arrested. Community members from the area retaliated and set alight the informal home of the arrested suspect and furniture of one of his relatives, Swart said. She said the Humansdorp cluster commander, Brigadier John Lebok, condemned the community&#8217;s actions. He further called for calm, for community members not to take law into their own hands and to work with the police to ensure that those responsible are brought to book, she said. The man is expected to appear in the Hankey Magistrate s Court on a charge of murder on Monday. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
