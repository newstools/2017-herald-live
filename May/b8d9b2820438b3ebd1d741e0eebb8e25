The Automobile Association (AA) is cautiously optimistic that the petrol price will drop by about 24c per litre from next month a prediction that would be a welcome development for consumers. Ongoing volatility in international oil prices has been matched by swings in the Rand/US dollar exchange rate making fuel price predictions as tricky as ever the AA said in a statement on Tuesday morning. It said that while the rand started the month strongly against the dollar which bodes well for petrol prices it had since weakened. It was a similar case with the international cost of petroleum which started the month relatively cheap but made something of a comeback in the past few days . Despite this volatility the consumer was still winning the association said. The current data [predicts] a drop of 24 cents a litre for petrol 20 cents for diesel and 21 cents for illuminating paraffin. We wouldn t rely on these figures though since a lot could change by month end the AA commented. &#8211; TMG Digital/TimesLIVE Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
