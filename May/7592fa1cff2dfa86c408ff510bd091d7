President Jacob Zuma Picture: Masi Losi Some 62% of ANC voters polled by Ipsos disapprove of President Jacob Zuma while only 18% support him suggesting that his continued presidency is exacting a heavy price on the party s electability. The poll done in conjunction with eNCA surveyed 3 500 adults between 21 April and 22 May this year. eNCA reported: Zuma s current approval rating is the lowest score ever for any of the country s democratically elected presidents. The poll suggests that Zuma s support is in a tailspin after it showed he had the backing of 54% of ANC voters in December 2016. Some 65% of voters said Zuma should resign. The poll came as mounting evidence of Zuma s involvement in state capture entered the public domain causing senior ANC figures to distance themselves from him.
