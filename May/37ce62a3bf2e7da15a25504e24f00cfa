Robbie Malinga Picture: FREDLIN ADRIAAN Legendery hitmaker Robbie Malinga will be working behind the scenes in future to produce new music talent. Malinga was in Port Elizabeth yesterday to discuss his last album, The Duets. He said his decision to stop making albums was not difficult as he had been in the industry for 20 years but only released four albums. I m not quitting music. I m not going to release any album under Robbie Malinga. I m going to be a producer, songwriter and whatever else I can do in the industry, Malinga said. I ve been a behind-the-scenes guy for a very long time. Let me rather go and develop these young stars and show them the way, be a mentor, a father figure because they need that. Malinga visited The Herald as part of a thank you tour for his fans. The Duets, released in November, reached gold status after selling more than 20 000 copies. It features well-known artists such as Zahara, Ntando, Musa and Kelly Khumalo. Malinga s album and Musa s Mr Serious will compete for best afro-pop category as both albums were nominated for the 23rd South African Music Awards (Sama) on May 27 in Sun City. He said his music was based on his own life experiences. I don t write about things that don t exist. He said his career highlights included working on Zahara s album Loliwe.
