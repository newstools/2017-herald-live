The feud between a woman known as Buhle Mkhize and Norma Gigaba took another unexpected turn after a Facebook page pretending to belong to Buhle went viral. The page which carried Buhle s name and picture hurled razor-sharp insults at Norma and threatened to leak nude videos of Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba. The page also posted a screenshot it claimed showed Malusi begging Buhle for forgiveness. A Twitter account set up in the name of Buhle then distanced itself from the page and warned fans not to be duped. My Instagram and Facebook will NEVER have such again. And this is NOT even my name on Facebook.

The minister later released a statement denying the claims. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
