ONLY 30% of households in South Africa own a car which means 70% to 80% of the population depends on taxis buses and trains. This alarming fact emerged when the Competition Commission announced yesterday that a transport market inquiry would assess the general state of competition in transport because it played a crucial role for economic inclusiveness in the country. Transportation costs hammer household income. The commission estimates the hourly wage is reduced by 40% or more and is likely to be a detrimental effect on consumer welfare particularly on low-income households. The purpose of the inquiry according to the commission is to identify factors that lessen prevent or distort competition which reduce the overall benefits to consumers. The survey will cover both the public and private sectors. It will assess minibus taxis localised taxis metered taxis app-based taxi services train services including Metrorail and Gautrain, and buses. Buses that fall into the survey are commuter and long-distance buses, given that the majority of the population relies on these buses according to the commission. The minibus taxi sector grew significantly to meet the needs of commuters who relied on public bus and rail services. Uber the ride-sharing app entered the market in 2013 with a few local services picking up on the trend. The ongoing conflict between metered taxis and the app-based Uber is one visible outcome of problems with transport as is the violence between rival minibus taxi groups.
