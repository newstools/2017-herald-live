Paw Patrol s Marshall and Skye at the Kirkwood Festival Picture: FREDLIN ADRIAAN The SPAR Kirkwood Wildsfees festival kicks off on June 30 and promises to be a jam-packed event with wine tasting and national music acts. Jack Parow, Sonja Herholdt and PJ Powers will all take to the stage during the three-day festival. Festival director Jennifer Honsbein said there would be many family activities. Kirkwood is a large and wonderfully productive community that unfortunately goes by without being noticed most of the time, she said. We want to highlight the fact that it brings in a lot of investment. All proceeds of the festival go towards the Kirkwood community. Festival media facilitator Ed Richardson said: The festival is built around the objective of bringing tourists into the valley. Kirkwood is a hidden gem in the midst of the Eastern Cape. The idea is to get people there to see the development that has taken place over the last 16 years. There will be 350 stalls, a South African White Gold Mohair expo, agri expo and a Coca Cola comedy show featuring funny man Roland Gaspar.
