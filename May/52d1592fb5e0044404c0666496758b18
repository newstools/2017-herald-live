An elderly man was held hostage in his Cotswold home this week after a burglar hid in the bathroom and waited for him to return to the house. The 77-year-old man, whom police are not naming, was attacked by the lone robber shortly after 4pm. Police spokeswoman Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said that on returning to his Lewerkie Street home, the man had been confronted by the robber armed with a knife. After a tussle, the man was taken to the bedroom and tied up. The suspect ransacked the room and stole two firearms from a safe. After he fled, the man managed to free himself and alerted the authorities. The suspect gained entry via a bathroom window that was not fitted with burglar bars.
