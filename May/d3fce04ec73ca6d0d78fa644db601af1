Twenty-two people, including children, were killed and dozens injured when a man detonated a bomb at a pop concert by US star Ariana Grande, in Britain&#8217;s deadliest terror attack in 12 years. Screaming fans, many of them teens, fled the venue in panic after the bomb blast at the end of the concert in the northern English city of Manchester on Monday evening. &#8220;There was heat on my neck and when I looked up there were bodies everywhere&#8221;, Elena Semino, who was waiting for her 17-year-old daughter, told the Guardian newspaper. Semino, who was herself injured, said she had been standing by the ticket office of the 21,000-capacity indoor Manchester Arena when the explosion went off. &#8220;A huge bomb-like bang went off that hugely panicked everyone and we were all trying to flee the arena&#8221;, said Majid Khan, 22, who was at the show with his sister. Ambulances and bomb disposal teams rushed to the venue, as family members frantically searched for their loved ones, and residents opened their doors to stranded concert-goers after trains were cancelled. &#8220;There were children among the 22 killed in the attack, while 59 people were injured,&#8221; Greater Manchester Police chief Ian Hopkins said early Tuesday.
