Eliose Webb Picture: Fredlin Adriaan Putting in long hours of training has paid off for NMMU student and Border Bulldogs fullback Eliose Webb, who has received a call-up to join the threeday women s 15s Springbok rugby camp taking place in Cape Town. Webb started playing rugby while in her matric year at Grens Ho rskool in East London. I would say it is the team aspect of sport that makes me love it, Webb said. However I am very nervous as this is a national camp. The people I play with also make me enjoy rugby and the training call-up means a lot to me and is where my rugby career is headed. It doesn t matter where you come from if you have love for the game, she said. No Springbok women s side has been picked since 2014 due to injuries in the squad and officials trying to bring about development. It is good to see that the woman Boks are at it again and we are excited to see the talent that is to come from this camp, said former women s Springbok captain and veteran Namhla Siyolo. With the competition strong and each player looking to prove herself, Webb has expressed her concerns on fitness and the level of competition she will be going up against at the training camp. To be honest I fear that my level of fitness may not be where it should be and I hope I do not battle to cope at the camp, she said. The intensity of training at varsity isn t as vigorous as in that level of competition, but then again the fitness will always vary everywhere and in what competition you participate in. Webb, who recently played for the Springboks women s sevens, will have to adjust to the transition of playing in the 15s setup. Joining Webb from Port Elizabeth will be Aseza Hele from Zwide and nine other women from the Border Bulldogs who represent the Eastern Cape. Webb will be representing the Madibaz women in the USSA sevens rugby tournament to be hosted at NMMU in August if she makes the squad.
