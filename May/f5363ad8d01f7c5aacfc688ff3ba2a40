The DA want the Parliament s Chair of Chairs to look into possible political interference in Eskom by Duduzane Zuma. File photo. The DA will write to parliament s chair of chairs Cedric Frolick to urge that the most recent evidence of possible political interference in Eskom this time by Duduzane Zuma also be investigated in the course of the inquiry the DA has requested. The DA requested more than a week ago that parliament s public enterprises committee launch a fullscale parliamentary inquiry into Eskom without delay. DA spokeswoman on public enterprises Natasha Mazzone said yesterday she would now seek an update as to when the inquiry would go ahead. The Sunday Times reported that President Jacob Zuma was said to have used a devious intelligence report compiled by Duduzane his son to effect the suspensions of four top Eskom executives in 2015. It said the move paved the way for Brian Molefe s first posting to Eskom as chief executive and came months after Gupta associate Salim Essa s efforts to score Trillian s first contract at the power utility had fallen flat. Mazzone said now more than ever Public Enterprises Minister Lynne Brown needed to appear before the parliament committee on public enterprises tomorrow and account for this deepening nightmare at Eskom. The latest revelation and the recent return of Brian Molefe as Eskom CEO are no coincidence at all, Mazzone said. The Gupta-Zuma mafia has shown that they will stop at nothing to ensure that Eskom becomes their personal fiefdom. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
