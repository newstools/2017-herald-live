Zodwa Twecu is on the gospel line-up for this weekend Music returns to the main stage at the Port Elizabeth Opera House this weekend when the new Music Concert Series introduces its first gospel night on Saturday. This inaugural gospel series will feature a number of the Bay s top acts, such as the popular Andile B, Nombongo Siyona, Zodwa Twecu and the latest addition to the genre, Tuni. Andile B will light up the stage of the Opera House performing tracks from his popular albums, such as Jehova Jaira and Ke Tsamaya le Jeso. Born in Alexandria, Andile B had a rocky start to his musical career after a failed afro-pop album but he has eventually found success as a gospel artist. He was assisted in his rise to fame by Sipho Mbele who had produced the likes of the late Lundi way back in 2001. In 2001, I decided to record my own album and at the time I was forced to sing afro-pop. However, the album did not do well at all, Andile B said. I was just not comfortable with that style of music. I knew that I had to go back to my roots, that is, to sing gospel. In 2002, I was given a chance to record my first gospel album, Ndenze Nkosi, which was successfully followed by Jehova Jairo in 2003, he said. Opera House PR and marketing officer Cingiwe Skosana said the music concert series was made up of the cream of Nelson Mandela Bay talent who would be gracing the main stage at the music venue. People can look out for exciting national and local talent who are going to do great things on the main stage and they can also ready themselves for a few surprises lined up by the PE Opera House, Skosana said. The Music Concert Series runs from this week until December and will consist of one concert every month, starting at 7pm. Tickets are R150 per person or R200 for a double ticket.
