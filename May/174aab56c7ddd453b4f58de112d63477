Larissa Waters returned to the upper house Senate for the first time Tuesday since giving birth to her second child, and brought her in for a feed during a vote. &#8220;So proud that my daughter Alia is the first baby to be breastfed in the federal Parliament! We need more #women &amp; parents in Parli,&#8221; she wrote on Twitter. So proud that my daughter Alia is the first baby to be breastfed in the federal Parliament!

Under previous rules, children were technically banned. Labor frontbencher Katy Gallagher said the moment deserved to be acknowledged. &#8220;Women have been doing it in parliaments around the world&#8230; It is great to see it is able to occur now in the Senate,&#8221; she told Sky News. &#8220;Women are going to continue to have babies and if they want to do their job and be at work and look after their baby&#8230; the reality is we are going to have to accommodate that.&#8221; Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
