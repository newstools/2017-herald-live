Twitter is due to launch a 24-hour streaming news channel in partnership with the Bloomberg news agency, in a major expansion of the social network s video operations. We ll have more to say about this exciting partnership at Bloomberg Media s NewFronts, Bloomberg Media chief executive Justin Smith Smith tweeted, referring to a conference this week. The Wall Street Journal, which first reported the partnership, has said that Bloomberg will produce news exclusively for the online channel, separate from content produced for Bloomberg s own television channel. Bloomberg and Twitter declined to offer more details, pending an announcement this week. The service, set to launch later this year, could help Twitter expand its user base, which has been growing slower than its social media rivals. Twitter has been seeking to broaden its appeal beyond its core base of celebrities and politicians, ramping up efforts in video and live sports.
