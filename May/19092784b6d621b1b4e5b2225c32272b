The son of Proteas bowling legend Makhaya Ntini has been named in the South Africa Under-19 squad to take on the West Indies in a five-match Youth ODI series in Durban and Pietermaritzburg in July. Thando Ntini is one of nine new caps in the squad that will captained by Raynard van Tonder against the highly-rated West Indians who won the 2016 ICC Under-19 World Cup in Bangladesh. The other six players in the squad were part of the team that beat Sri Lanka in an ODI series in January and include experienced campaigner Wandile Makwetu the most-capped player in the side, having made his debut at the 2016 World Cup. Coach Lawrence Mahatlane said he was pleased with the team he selected and believed the series would serve as valuable preparation for the 2018 U19 World Cup in New Zealand in January. Testing ourselves against the world champions is an ideal opportunity for us as a team to see where we are with the 2018 World Cup just around the corner Mahatlane said. Cricket South Africa high-performance manager Vincent Barnes said: With the ICC Under-19 World Cup only a few months away the West Indies series is a very important series for our team.
