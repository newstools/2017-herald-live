Smoke swept through the airport&#8217;s Terminal 2 building after a fire broke out in the departure hall, spurring authorities to seal off the area. There were no reports of injuries. &#8220;A small fire occurred at the departure hall of Changi Airport Terminal 2. The fire has been extinguished by SCDF [Singapore Civil Defence Force],&#8221; the Singapore Police said in a statement. Police said the fire alarm was activated at around 5:40pm (0940 GMT) as smoke poured from air vents, sparking an evacuation order and closure of the terminal. Passengers on flights departing from the terminal on Tuesday evening &#8220;should expect significant delays,&#8221; airport management said. Singapore Airlines added that all its departing and arriving flights at Terminal 2 will be delayed. &#8220;We are working closely with the airport authority and various agencies to ensure flights can be resumed in the shortest time possible,&#8221; the carrier said in a statement. An AFP reporter at the airport said the scene was generally calm as the departure and arrival halls were evacuated. Airport staff were also seen leaving but there was no panic.
