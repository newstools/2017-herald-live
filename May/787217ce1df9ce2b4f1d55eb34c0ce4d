Social worker at Dora Nginza Hospital, Pamela Rubushe, is urgently looking for the father of a newborn baby that was found abandoned at the KFC at Njoli Square in Kwazakhele this morning at 9am. Eastern Cape Health Department spokesman, Sizwe Kupelo, said the child was wrapped in a towel soaked in methyalated spirits and they think the mother wanted to set the little girl alight. Before the community intervened the mother was heard shouting to someone on the phone: What must I do with this thing (of yours), Kupelo said. Kupelo asked that anybody who know&#8217;s who the father is must urgently contact Dora Nginza Hospital where the baby was hospitalised. &nbsp; Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
