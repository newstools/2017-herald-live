Having read Telford Vice s report on the first ODI against England ( Proteas crumble against England , May 25), I feel I must take issue with his report, as it does not give a true reflection of the game to the reader who did not see the game on TV. The Proteas did indeed crumble against England, as he states, but to say What of [AB] De Villiers, that proven match-winner? He scored a promising 45, then holed out at deep mid-wicket. But promising 45s do not win matches like this. The point that he misses is that De Villiers was batting well and we were in with a chance, but JP Duminy, David Miller and especially Chris Morris gave their wickets away. It therefore left De Villiers with no option but to chase the runs, which he did, before he holed out to deep mid-wicket. Come on Telford, give your readers a true report of what happened.
