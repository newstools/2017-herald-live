The split rumours have once again reared their head and this time Pearl Thusi and Robert Marawa are the victims. City Press reported that there was trouble in paradise for the couple and even said their split was so big they were having fights in plain view of their Twitter followers with numerous sub-tweets. Odd cause Pearl has constantly been talking about her bae on her Insta stories and was spotted wearing her engagement ring on Sunday the day the split report came out. Team Pearl has refused to comment but you can bet that the Quantico star will address it all when she s in the mood. In the meantime cava her happiness. Ring and all. #nailedit A post shared by Pearl Thusi (@pearlthusi) on May 8, 2017 at 5:34am PDT Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
