The vehicle was parked outside a tavern in Laurence Vinqi Road when three men approached the owner pretending to be looking for a taxi. Police spokesman Sergeant Majola Nkohli said the vehicle owner was choked and forced into the back seat. They also pointed a firearm at the driver. He was later dropped off in Nene Street, a few metres away. Police are investigating a case of hijacking. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
