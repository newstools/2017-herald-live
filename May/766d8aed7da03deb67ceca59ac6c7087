GOOD TO BE BACK: Brumbies scrumhalf De Wet Roos will enjoy some home support against the Southern Kings Picture: GETTY IMAGES There will be a few South Africans cheering for the Brumbies when they face the Southern Kings at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium on Saturday. More than 20 000 fans are expected at the stadium to see if the Kings can make it four Super Rugby wins on the bounce against the Australians. Brumbies scrumhalf De Wet Roos is returning to the land of his birth and is hoping to play a major part in front of family and friends who will be attending the clash. I have about 15 family members travelling down to the game, Roos said. There are a few coming from Johannesburg, Pretoria and a few in the Free State that will be coming down to support the Brumbies and not the Kings, which will be nice for us to have some support at the venue. Hopefully, they are loud enough so we can hear them! Roos has settled in well to life at the top level following his call-up to the Brumbies after the injury suffered by Argentine Tomas Cubelli in the pre-season. It was always a dream of mine, but I never thought it would happen, he said. It s good being back in the motherland and to play rugby in front of my family will be special. If you are a little boy in South Africa you are always aspiring to become a Springbok and play rugby for your local club side. In this game we probably need to switch over to our more attacking mindset when we have made a break to become that little bit more ruthless when we get opportunities. We must say to ourselves that we will come away with a try and be composed in that area. We defend well. I think the tries we have given away have been off turnovers. We need to make sure our attack matches that, Roos said. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
