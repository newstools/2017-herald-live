SAA cabin crew went on strike last month Picture: Jan Bornman The Labour Court yesterday confirmed as final the interim order it made last week interdicting and restraining South African Cabin Crew Association (Sacca) members from embarking on a strike. Acting Judge Sean Snyman made this order after listening to arguments from counsel for South African Airways (SAA) and the union. The airline wanted the interim order it obtained on Wednesday last week to be made final, while the union opposed the airline s request. Snyman said he would give reasons for his order on May 10. There was no order as to costs. Last week members of the union embarked on a strike over a dispute about international meal allowances payable to cabin crew staff. The airline had not increased the meal allowance since 2011. Cabin crew are getting a $131 (R1 754) international meal allowance but are demanding that management adjust this allowance to $170 (R2 276) a day. The strike resulted in the cancellation of more than 30 flights at airports around the country as there were not enough cabin crew members for all of the flights. It also resulted in SAA incurring losses amounting to R25-million on the day as a result of flight cancellations. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
