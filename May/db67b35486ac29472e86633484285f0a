The slot for beginners and intermediate participants is on Saturday May 27 from 10 to 11.30am and the next slot, from 1.30 to 3pm on the Saturday, will be open to all categories. I ve opened the workshop to all dancers in and around the Bay as I want everyone who loves dance to have the opportunity to experience Rudi s work, Tai said.
