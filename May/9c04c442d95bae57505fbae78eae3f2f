A PE College lecturer, accused of raping a former student at his home in Central, was released on bail by the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court yesterday. The 32-year-old man, originally from Butterworth, made his first appearance in court and his case was immediately transferred to another courtroom where a formal bail application took place. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Alwin Labans said the alleged incident had happened on Sunday evening, and the man had been arrested the next day. According to the complainant s statement, the accused phoned her on Sunday and asked her to come to his residence in Whitlock Street, Labans said. She went there at about 5.30pm and that is where the alleged rape took place. The woman, 22, reported the incident to the Humewood police station shortly afterwards. His attorney said he had no pending cases and no previous convictions, and needed to work to pay child support for his four-year-old son and care for his mother in Butterworth. The state did not oppose the application and he was released on R1 000 bail, with several conditions, including that he is prohibited from contacting the complainant. PE College Russell Road campus manager Kim Matikinca said she had no knowledge of the incident as the matter had not been reported to her. Of course we are concerned, but the incident did not occur on campus and until it is formally reported to us we cannot give any comment about the alleged incident, she said. The man, who cannot be named until he pleads, will return to court on June 13. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
