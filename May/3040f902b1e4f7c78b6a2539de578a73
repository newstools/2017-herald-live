A final-year BCom student was this week excluded for 10 years from Rhodes University after being found guilty of rape by the university. A three-member disciplinary board for sexual offences which heard the case has also directed the student not to enter the university campus for the duration of his exclusion. His academic record will also be endorsed as unsatisfactory, the university said yesterday. Any credits that he may obtain from any other university during his 10 years of exclusion will not be recognised by Rhodes University. In its verdict, the board ruled that rape filled society with a sense of revulsion and undermined women s equality and freedom. Rhodes vice-chancellor Dr Sizwe Mabizela said the university had zerotolerance for sexual and gender-based violence. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
