James Aguma Picture: Freddy Mavunda / Financial Mail Political parties and parliament s standing committee on public accounts (Scopa) have welcomed the suspension of SABC acting chief financial officer James Aguma. The broadcaster announced at the weekend that Aguma had been suspended but would not reveal further details due to internal processes. SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago said Aguma would be replaced by Tseliso Ralitabo the broadcaster s media technology and infrastructure executive. Aguma s suspension comes after calls last week by Scopa for his removal because of his role in the messy state of affairs at the public broadcaster. COPE deputy president and member of the communications committee in parliament Willy Madisha said the party welcomed the suspension. The EFF cautioned the SABC against being run by people connected to former chief operations officer Hlaudi Motsoeneng. To rescue the SABC . . . we need men and women of integrity who are able to reverse the mess caused by Hlaudi and his cabal. It is therefore commendable that the SABC interim board have taken this decision, EFF spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi said. We call for the process of his hiring to be escalated together with his master Motsoeneng. The two hand in hand caused the financial crisis that has compromised the SABC. The ANC study group on Scopa said Aguma s suspension came after its recent recommendation to this effect. The DA s communications spokeswoman, Phumzile van Damme, said Aguma should face a forensic investigation and a disciplinary inquiry.
