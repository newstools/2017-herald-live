&#8216;My Daddy is a Sill Monkey My Daddy is a Silly Monkey by Dianne Hofmeyr illustrated by Carol Thompson, published by Tafelberg, R139 (hardcover edition R219) This is the latest in a string of dozens of books by former art teacher Dianne Hofmeyr a South African who now lives in London and who has had her children s books translated into several languages. It takes a delightful look at a single chaotic day in the life of a very hands-on father as he moves from animal to animal, starting with a grizzly-bearded bear and morphing eventually into a tired human by bedtime. The illustrations by Carol Thompson are fresh and full of life. This would be an ideal gift for a new dad for Father s Day, which is coming up soon. It also would a be a great book for a single dad or any parent actually to read to a pre-schooler. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
