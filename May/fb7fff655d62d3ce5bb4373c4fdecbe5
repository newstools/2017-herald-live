Picture: Siyamtanda Capa UDM supporters marched to the Wool Exchange building on Military Road today in support of deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani. The group of more than 80 sang struggle songs and vowed they would not allow Bobani to be removed. While some said they were aware that the difference had been sorted out, they still felt their leader was under siege. A resident who identified herself only as Noluthando claimed that mayor Athol Trollip was dishonest.

A small group of Helenvale residents also gathered in Military Road. Desira Davids of Helenvale said they wanted to further voice out their grievances with Trollip. The escalating battle between the DA s Trollip and the UDM s Bobani reached boiling point last week when the deputy mayor was ousted as a member of the mayoral committee in charge of the public health portfolio. Trollip said last week they would table a motion in the council to remove Bobani as deputy, while Bobani was said to be lobbying opposition parties to not only reject such a move, but rather support a bid to remove Trollip as mayor. However, last night a deal was clinched in Cape Town to save the Nelson Mandela Bay coalition from the brink of collapse. Council is currently in session. Some of the other items on the agenda to be considered are a R15-million bailout for EP Rugby and the appointment of Vuyo Zitumane. More to follow.
