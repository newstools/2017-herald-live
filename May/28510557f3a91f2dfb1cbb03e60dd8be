Day 7 of the Henri van Breda murder trial got under way in the Cape Town High Court on Monday morning. He is accused of hacking his parents and brother to death with an axe at their luxury Stellenbosch home in 2015. His sister miraculously survived the attack. Last week the court heard testimony from two security guards who work at the estate. When Henri and his legal team arrived at the court his one public supporter &#8211; Ralph Montjies &#8211; waited to greet him with a handshake. Montjies is a bus driver from the Strand and takes a train every day to pray for the 22-year-old triple murder accused. On Monday he was there with a younger man who also greeted Van Breda. &#8220;Someone has to show some support for you &#8221; said Montjies who took a seat in the public gallery. -TMG Digital/TimesLIVE Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
