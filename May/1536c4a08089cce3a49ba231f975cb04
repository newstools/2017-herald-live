Poor repairs to the ring road between Uitenhage and Despatch/ Port Elizabeth have resulted in the road becoming a milkshake ally (I no longer see the contractors on site and therefore assume the road repairs are complete). The once smooth surface has become bumpy where resurfacing interface with the old occurs. Cats eyes are irregular and not replaced properly and in one area two cats eyes encroach on the outer lane that creates a hazard in misty conditions. Generally, old cats eyes are now also ineffective. With regard to transition smoothness, the contractors responsible for the upgrade only have to navigate their way around Port Elizabeth to see that transition smoothness can be achieved with a little care and attention to detail without incurring additional expense. I therefore trust that this has been noticed by others and the contract allocators, and that corrective action will be taken. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
