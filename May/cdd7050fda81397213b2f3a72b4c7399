A Durban father whose teenage daughter allegedly received nude images and sexually suggestive messages from her school teacher was left fuming and disappointed when he was excluded from a bail application for the man in the Durban Magistrate&#8217;s Court on Wednesday. The teacher &#8211; accused of sending nude images and sexually suggestive messages to a 14-year-old pupil &#8211; was granted bail of R6 000. He was represented by a high powered legal team. The suspended educator is facing criminal charges relating to sexual grooming of a minor and child pornography. The girl&#8217;s parents said they were &#8220;disappointed&#8221; they had been excluded from the court proceedings. The father was forced to approach the prosecutor after the bail hearing to ask why they had not been allowed to sit in on the application. &#8220;I won&#8217;t let this matter rest. It&#8217;s unbelievable that we as parents who brought the charges against him had to sit outside the courtroom. &#8220;We were completely in the dark and made out to be fools.&#8221; The parents later learnt that the prosecutor &#8211; who refused to identify herself to media &#8211; was unaware they were present in court. The teacher who appeared dishevelled beat a hasty retreat with his supporters in tow. The media was also barred by the presiding magistrate from covering the teacher&#8217;s bail bid. Objections were raised by reporters who were informed by the prosecutor that juvenile matters are held in camera. However there were joyous celebrations outside Court 9 after the alleged sex pest teacher was granted bail. The teacher&#8217;s supporters most of them congregants of the church he attends broke into applause when they learnt he had been granted bail. He was arrested two weeks ago after the father of the teenage girl became suspicious of him and discovered explicit pictures as well as texts on her phone. His next appearance will be June 30.
