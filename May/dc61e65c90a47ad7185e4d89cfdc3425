PE Opera House manager Monde Ngonyama Picture: EUGENE COETZEE The Port Elizabeth Opera House had its official 2017 programme launch at the Barn yesterday. Opera House general manager Monde Ngonyama highlighted some of the programmes expected at the venue from May 12 to June 16 ranging from comedy shows, dance, drama and everything in between. Ngonyama pointed out that the Opera House was a space that ran its own programmes and that the public could also hire the venue for their own productions and events. However, there were times when people hired the venue without having sufficient experience and knowledge to stage a production, he said. They will go to social media to advertise without even having money to pay the actors. When those shows are cancelled, they say the Opera House cancelled the show. Ngonyama also encouraged local artists not to wait on government funding to bring productions forward, but to make use of the free platforms at their disposal, such as social media. In addition, Ngonyama revealed that the Opera House would be honouring two women who have contributed immensely to performing arts in Nelson Mandela Bay . The women are: founder of the well-known Stageworld drama school Marlene Pieterse and acclaimed actress and playwright Nomhle Nkonyeni. Programmes expected at the Opera House from next Friday May 12, include a production by Luyanda Madope at the intimate Barn theatre and a Local is Lekker music show on Saturday May 13, produced by San Entertainment, among others. Opera House communications officer Cingiwe Skosana also revealed the second cycle of the Opera House s drama and dance seasons which will include a dance production called Fallen Fools, choreographed by Mandilakhe Gwashu, and a drama production called Truck Drivers, directed by Nomhle Nkonyeni.
