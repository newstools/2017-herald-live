A Helenvale woman narrowly escaped death after a man opened fire on her at the weekend. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said the woman, 33, had been walking along Ibex Road at about 3pm on Saturday when a truck stopped next to her and two men climbed out. The woman knew the two men and an argument broke out between her and one of them. He then took out a firearm and fired a number of shots at her. The woman was not hit, however. Naidu said the incident seemed to be a personal dispute. An investigation is under way. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
