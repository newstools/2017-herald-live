Presented by Pemads at the Little Theatre in Central, Iconic Broadway is exactly what it says a melange of wistful and endearing musical numbers from some of the greatest shows performed to a live audience. Opening the production with Wilkommen from the Broadway hit musical Cabaret, Speyers sets the mood for an enjoyable experience and his collection of melodies from revered theatrical productions leave the audience nostalgic, while wanting more. Although the pacing of the snippets through theatre history does not always flow as smoothly as one would like, the show brings together notable talent with Marelize Booyens stealing the show. Her renditions of beloved tunes include Cabaret s Mein Herr, Jekyll and Hyde s Bring on the Men and Funny Girl s Don t Rain on my Parade. She embodies various characters portrayed before by the likes of Barbra Streisand and Liza Minnelli. And belting it out and keeping to the true nature of the original showpiece, Zena Bally s performance of One Night Only from Dreamgirls is admirable. Adding a bit of fun and spice to the show, Glen McIlroy s rendition of Dr Frank N Furter s Sweet Transvestite from The Rocky Horror Picture Show is convincing. No stranger to musical theatre, Sikho Gaika should be commended for his vocal agility. The choreography by Sian-Beth Hitchner gives the audience a taste of what each of the 20-plus Broadway shows are all about. Enjoyable from beginning to end, the show delivers the best of the greatest on one stage. Iconic Broadway is at 7.30pm until May 21, with a 2.30pm Sunday matinee. Tickets are R80 at Computicket or the theatre box office, 30 minutes before each performance. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
