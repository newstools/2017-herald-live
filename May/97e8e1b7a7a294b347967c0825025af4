A Port Elizabeth detective was shot dead in Veeplaas near Soweto-on-Sea yesterday. Detective Warrant Officer Wellbeloved Mtshawu, 49, was gunned down while driving in Koyana Road at about 4am. The bullet-riddled, unmarked police car was found in a shallow ditch, metres from the road, after it veered down an embankment. The motive for the killing is unknown. Most of the bullets punctured the rear window which, according to police, suggests Mtshawu was trying to speed away from his attackers. Detectives from the serious and violent crimes division have been roped in to help with the investigation. The incident took place near the intersection of Koyana and Chelsea roads, close to the Chatty River which borders Uitenhage Road. Mtshawu was attached to the Motherwell Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit. Officers on the scene said Mtshawu s state firearm had not been discharged and was still with him, while several police dockets were scattered around the vehicle. According to police, Mtshawu booked out the vehicle and told his commanders that he would be following up leads in an ongoing investigation. It was not yet known what case he was working on or why he had been working alone. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge confirmed that Mtshawu had been on duty at the time of his murder. At this stage, the circumstances surrounding the incident are unknown and police are investigating a case of murder, he said. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
