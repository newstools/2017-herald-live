Singing Ave Maria, holding hands in prayer, falling into each other&#8217;s arms crying or strolling past shops selling t-shirts with photos of the Argentine pontiff, pilgrims from all over the world have been gathering on and near the sprawling, white Catholic shrine this week.

We feel that Mama Mary has always been there to guide us,&#8221; said Regina, 54, standing near a giant sculpture of a rosary. Altogether, up to a million pilgrims are expected to descend on Fatima by foot, car or plane from countries as varied as China, South Korea, Mexico and Venezuela. The Virgin is said to have appeared six times in Fatima, north of Lisbon, between May and October 1917 to three impoverished, barely-literate children Jacinta, 7, Francisco, 9, and their cousin Lucia, 10.

These reportedly included a warning of a second war and the rise of communist Russia. On Saturday the 100th anniversary of the first reported apparition Pope Francis will canonise Jacinta and Francisco, who have officially been found responsible for two miracles.

His parents had prayed to the late Jacinta and Francisco for help. &#8220;The doctors, including non-believers, weren&#8217;t able to explain this recovery,&#8221; his father Joao Batista told reporters in Fatima on Thursday. Many pilgrims have trekked for days on foot to the central Portuguese town &#8212; some finishing the journey to the small Chapel of the Apparitions on their knees.

He leaves Rome at 2pm local time (1200 GMT) and lands more than two hours later at the Monte Real military base, north of Lisbon. After a welcome by Portugal&#8217;s President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, he will travel to Fatima by helicopter. There, he will arrive on the giant esplanade that faces the Sanctuary of Our Lady of Fatima in a &#8220;Popemobile&#8221; brought specially from Rome welcomed by some 400 000 faithful.

The day&#8217;s events and Saturday&#8217;s canonisation take place under high security. Some 6 000 members of security and emergency services have been mobilised. Cars will be banned from the immediate vicinity of the sanctuary, the airspace above will be closed and measures for jamming electronic signals implemented to prevent any flights of drones. Border controls, meanwhile, have been reinstated in the EU country through the weekend. 10 May 2017 &#8211; Pope Francis greets a child as he arrives in St Peter&#8217;s Square for his weekly audience in the Vatican City.
