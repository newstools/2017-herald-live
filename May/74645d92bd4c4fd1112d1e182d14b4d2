Cautious Southern Kings head coach Deon Davids is adamant his team will not be drawn into the off-field hype surrounding their eagerly awaited Super Rugby showdown against the Sharks tomorrow. More than 20 000 fans are expected at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium and Port Elizabeth has been gripped by rugby fever after the Kings scored impressive wins over the Waratahs and Melbourne Rebels in their previous games. A social media campaign, #FillOurStadium, has fuelled interest in the game. Maybe the hype is because we have done so well in the past two games and we lost narrowly to the Sharks in Durban in the first game, Davids said. I think our guys are quite focused on what we want to do and achieve. We have spoken about it. There is quite a lot of excitement in terms of getting better support. We were glad we could pull off two wins and we just want to build on that energy and feeling that we got from all the support. The coach said one of his team s goals at the start of the season was to gain more support from Eastern Cape rugby fans. We wanted to get more support back into the stadium to play for the metro and the franchise, and this is a step in the right direction in what we have set out to achieve. The more support we get the more encouragement there is for the guys. We are aware of it [the hype], but we are very focused on what want to do, Davids said. The resurgent Kings are facing a tough clash against a star-studded Sharks team who will attempt to use their pack to dominate the home team. We know that the Sharks scrum and the guys in the team are quality players, but I believe we have made a step up in terms of our set pieces in our recent games, Davids said. I am quite confident that our guys will be able to compete in the scrums.
