An independent forensic investigator assisting the family of Reshall Jimmy who burnt to death in his Ford Kuga has urged South Africans to stop buying Ford vehicles due to the appalling manner in which the company has allegedly handled the incident. Jimmy died in December 2015 in his luxury Ford Kuga SUV while on holiday in the Wilderness. Dr David Klatzow the forensic scientist the family has roped in to assist with the matter said it was time to put out a message to the buying public to boycott Ford vehicles. Ford said yesterday it was not commenting yet due to the sensitive nature of the matter. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
