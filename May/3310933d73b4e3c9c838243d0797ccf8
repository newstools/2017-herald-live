Thembisile Yende was found dead in her office at Eskom Picture: Mboneni Zakhele Yende / Facebook Search and rescue lead investigator Lourens Smit said foul play was suspected in the death of a woman whose body was found in her Eskom office at the Springs power station on Monday. When she was reported missing the whole office and its surroundings were checked by SAPS and the K9 unit. The family and community members also searched. Her body was definitely not at the office Smit said. On day 13 [13 days after she went missing] her body is found locked in her office. That definitely suggests foul play. Lourens also said Eskom s CCTV was working up until the day Thembisile Yende went missing. According to her cousin who went to the Eskom office the cameras were not working on the day that she went missing Smit added. Why the cameras were not working I don t know but there is definitely more to the disappearance. Eskom spokesman Khulu Phasiwe said the company did not yet have details surrounding Yende s death and that a postmortem would shed some light on what happened to her. All we know is that she was reported missing for two weeks. She was found in a sub station. Circumstances surrounding her death will be uncovered by the police investigation Phasiwe said. Police spokesman Kay Makhubele said the police have opened an inquest docket. It is alleged that the woman was last seen when she went to her work place at Eskom in Springs. Late in the evening the family went to the police station to report her missing after seeing that she was not coming back home and not answering her phone Makhubele said. Since then the police have been searching for the whereabouts of the woman. Yesterday [Monday] the police were called at Eskom where they pointed out one office which was not in use and had a funny smell.
