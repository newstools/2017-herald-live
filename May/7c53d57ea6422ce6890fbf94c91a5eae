Marah Louw&#8217;s book reveals details about her experience with abuse Veteran actress Marah Louw revisited the years of abuse she endured and explained why she has not hidden the identities of her alleged abusers in her recently released autobiography It s me Marah. The singer and former Idols SA judge was on DJ Sbu s breakfast show and said she made the decision to name the people who had allegedly abused her because she needed to be truthful to herself. Marah said that being honest meant she could not use pseudonyms as that would be defeating the very idea of talking about what she went through. She also detailed some of the violent incidents she allegedly had to endure by those close to her. There was a time he bashed my head into the taxi window. That taxi had other musicians inside Marah told Sbu. He owned spears and one day he chased after me with one and I ran into his mother s room where his sister slept. Maybe if I didn t do that I would have died she added. Marah who has also had a career in acting said that she was proud to have overcome everything and is now able to tell her story in her own words.
