Coach Dan Malesela has already star ted recruiting players for next season, despite there being no clarity on his future with Chippa United. Malesela was placed on special leave by the team s management due to poor results, but was recalled with two games remaining in a bid to help the club survive possible relegation. The team had not won since February, but after the return of Malesela, Chippa recorded only their second victory of the year, after having gone 12 matches without success. He admitted being unsure whether he would be with the team next season, but said he had started searching for players, which suggests he may be staying on with the club. Like I had said before, my contract runs up to 2019, and contracts are negotiable these days. Whether you want to stay or leave is another thing, Malesela said. Also, if the club is not entirely happy, we sit down and discuss matters. But, just to give you a hint, I have already started recruiting players so that tells you something. I can t bring people here and leave them here. In their last league win over Super- Sport United, the Port Elizabeth club moved from 15th position to 13th. But Chippa still need a point from their final match, tomorrow against Free State Stars, to survive the drop without relying on other results.
