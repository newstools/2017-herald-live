The scene of a suspected bombing at a luxury home in Durban.Picture : Jackie Clausen Police are searching for answers as they comb through the scene of a suspected bombing at a luxury home in Durban. Five people including two delivery men were injured when a bomb exploded in the early hours of Friday afternoon. The bomb was in a bunch of flowers or a package that had just been delivered to the home on Steven Dlamini (formerly Essenwood) Road in Durban&#8217;s Musgrave suburb according to neighbours and a family member who did not want to be named. One neighbour said there was a loud bang before 2pm. &#8220;It sounded like Beirut or Iraq &#8221; the neighbour said. Rescue Care paramedic Garrith Jamieson who was on the scene said: &#8220;Apparently a parcel was delivered to the house. As they opened it inside the lounge it exploded. The Bomb Squad is in attendance and will be doing further investigating.&#8221; Three family members were among the injured along with the two delivery men who dropped off the package. A family member who did not want to be identified said they had &#8220;no idea&#8221; why the incident happened and confirmed that one person broke a leg and another lost a thumb. They were rushed to the nearby Parklands Hospital. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
