Bay-based Jenni Gault is not only an international jewellery designer, she is also a mother and is spoiling The Herald readers with gifts worth almost R20 000 to mark the special day on Sunday. Mothers are extra special, and whatever tests you are facing, your mother has not only probably faced them before you but is facing them again with you, Gault says. How do we show Mom that we appreciate what she continues to do for us? Time. Time for coffee, for a phone call, for a dinner. Each of these give us the opportunity to share a little more of our life with her, and her with us. Bring a little beauty into her life, drop off a small house plant, give her a chocolate muffin. These are life s joys for the person to whom you owe everything. Not only the gift, but the fact that you took the time, considered her opinions, looked at the options available and selected the gift with love. It s never about the financial value. It is HER time to be spoiled and acknowledged. She does not bake the cake or cook the gammon, she gets loved! And, says Gault, you may like to show her that love by giving her something beautiful, such as an item of jewellery and 20 readers of The Herald will win just that. These are the Jenni Gault International Jewellery Design prizes offered for Mother s Day: First prize: a Cielo ring, Grande Deux stud earrings in the royal fruits colours, a R200 gift voucher and Endless Love pendant, valued at R3 750. Second prize: a Cielo ring, Grande Deux stud earrings in the royal fruits colours and a R200 gift voucher, valued at R1 550. 18 runner-up prizes of Grande Deux stud earrings in the royal fruits colours and a R200 gift voucher, valued at R800 each.
