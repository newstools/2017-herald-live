Gavin Dunston pours customer Benjamin Afrika an aromatic cup of early morning coffee Picture: Eugene Coetzee If you like your coffee to go, a Port Elizabeth mini coffee bar actually does go, and it really is a Mini in every sense. An enterprising Richmond Hill resident gets people revved up for the day ahead by providing their caffeine fix and a homemade treat from his little wheels early every morning. Motorists and passersby cannot miss the bright orange Mini Cooper from which Gavin Dunston, 42, runs his coffee bar, parked at the entrance of the traffic department in Durban Road, Korsten. Dunston said he had bought the Mini back in 1994 and used it as a private car. When his family printing business could not generate enough income, he decided to find another way to earn extra money. I was thinking of what I could do. I decided making coffee was the easiest because I didn t have to cook or fry anything all I had to do was boil water and add coffee and sugar, the bachelor said. Dunston, who does his coffee rounds at the traffic department from Monday to Friday, from 5am to 9am, says his customers include people on their way to work and those who start queuing at the department from as early as 6am. When the Mini becomes a coffee bar, the front passenger seat is removed to create a work station. When it goes back to being a car, the seat goes back. I sell Nescafe, Ricoffy and Jacobs Kronung. I also sell a variety of homemade biscuits baked by my mother Sylvia at R6 for a packet of four, he said. His family and friends found his idea novel. I ve met some interesting people doing this. My customers include everyone from car guards to businessmen and I ve sold coffee to people from all walks of life. I love meeting new people, Dunston said.
