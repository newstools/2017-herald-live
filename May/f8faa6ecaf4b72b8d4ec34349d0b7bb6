New &#8216;Smurfs&#8217; activity book Based on the latest Smurf s movie Smurfs The Lost Village, this 16-page soft-cover activity book is ideal for a busy toddler. The ages recommended for this book are from 3-6 years old but my two-year-old son loves to play with the bright stickers and create different scenes with the characters on a backdrop in the book from the movie. The book has a range of activities that are easy for the young kids to the more advanced activities for the older kids. Some highlights include basic crosswords, colouring in smurf scenes and, of course, the two pages of beautiful stickers. The kids will have fun while developing skills such as observation, drawing and colouring in. These activity books are smurftastic and guaranteed to keep your kids busy for a few hours.
