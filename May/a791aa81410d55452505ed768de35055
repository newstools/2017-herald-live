Chippa United s strikers need to be more aggressive in front of goal if they are to stave off possible relegation, caretaker coach Mbuyiselo Sambu said. The Port Elizabeth side have had a successful journey in the Nedbank Cup so far, having reached the semifinals of the competition, but it is their form in the Premier Soccer League that is worrying Sambu. The Chilli Boys have been struggling to score goals in the PSL this season. They have won only five of the 26 league matches played with 12 defeats and nine draws. The team is 13th on the log and just two points off the relegation zone. Sambu, 33, said the team lacked the aggression in front of goal that saw them finish sixth last season. If we can really put our focus on that, and also not forget the defence because we have conceded many goals, then we will get the wins we need, he said. The main worry is the lack of goals. That is why we are losing games. We have to find the combination that will give us the necessary aggression we need in terms of getting goals. We need a sober mind, knowing that we have a responsibility as well in terms of helping the team get our defensive organisation proper before we can think of opening up and playing toe-to-toe. Even in boxing if you go toe-to-toe you might make silly mistakes, because you are not thinking straight. It s very important for us to make sure that as much as thinking of goals, our defensive organisation is also well balanced, Sambu said. Chippa s next fixture is against Ajax Cape Town at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane on Saturday (3pm). Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
