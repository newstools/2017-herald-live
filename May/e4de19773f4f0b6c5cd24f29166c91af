Three stolen firearms, two of them hunting rifles, were confiscated in two separate arrests in Nelson Mandela Bay between Monday night and early yesterday. The busts, which occurred between 10.30pm on Monday and 2am yesterday, come just days after three armed response officers had their firearms stolen in separate attacks. Two of the armed response officers were shot in the weekend robberies. The firearms have still not been found. Police spokesman Sergeant Majola Nkohli said that shortly after 10.30pm on Monday police received a tip-off about a VW Polo, with four men inside, was at a fuel station in KwaNobuhle, Uitenhage The police followed up, searched the Polo and nabbed four men with two illegal firearms and empty cartridges. The firearms were a 303 hunting rifle and a .38 special revolver with empty cartridges, he said. At about 2am yesterday, police pulled over a white VW Golf in Mendi Road, New Brighton. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said: A search of the car found a .22 rifle lying between the two front seats. The firearm was loaded and ready to shoot. Investigations revealed the car had been stolen in the Humewood policing area earlier this month. The two occupants, aged 21 and 22, will appear in the New Brighton Magistrate s Court today. In both incidents the vehicles were seized. All the firearms had their serial numbers filed off. The ballistic division has the firearms and is testing them. We will be able to determine where they were stolen and if they have been used in any other crimes, Beetge said. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
