After a four-month absence from soccer due to injury, top Chippa United striker Rhulani Manzini is fit and ready to bang in goals once more for the Chilli Boys. Manzini had been ruled out of action since September due to injury. Many believe the return of the former Platinum Stars player, 28, might help the Port Elizabeth team s scoring problems. The striker is aware that with the likes of seasoned striker Kathlego Mashego, Lerato Manzini, Andile Mbenyana and David Zulu, breaking into the starting lineup might be a challenge, but said he was ready for the fight. I am happy that I am back training with the team after four months of not playing, Manzini said. It feels good to be back. I am working very hard to get back to my old self and I trust in God for goals when we play Baroka FC on February 7. Coach Dan Malesela said last week that Manzini s return would create positive competition among the players. The striker agreed with Malesela, saying: We have good strikers, the likes of Mashego, Manzini and Zulu the competition is healthy, but I am ready to compete with them. I am working very hard and I am improving slowly. I will get there. I will definitely be ready for Baroka. Manzini said he was capable of scoring more goals and increasing his goal tally at the club. My plan with the team is for the team to win the league and the last cup that is on, which is the Nedbank Cup. The Chilli Boys have travelled to Cape Town for preparations for the second leg of the Premier Soccer League. Chippa have moved their match against Baroka, scheduled for February 8, to February 7. The game will take place at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
