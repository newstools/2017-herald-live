An elderly Kirkwood farmer had his nest egg stolen allegedly by his banker after he entrusted the woman with R400 000 that he had kept tucked underneath his mattress. Andries Renken, 83, discovered later that an additional R420 000 had been withdrawn from his First National Bank account without his permission. Leonie Stiemie, 45, an administrator at the FNB s Kirkwood branch at the time, pleaded not guilty in the Port Elizabeth Commercial Crimes Court to two counts of theft totalling R820 000. She is the sister-in-law of Port Elizabeth bookkeeper and comedian Tertius Stiemie, who is serving a 10-year jail term for the theft of nearly R1-million. Testifying yesterday, FNB business development manager Werner Stapelberg said Renken had trusted Stiemie and believed his money would be safe at the bank. Whenever Mr Renken went to the bank, he would only deal with Leonie, Stapelberg told the court. In mid-2011, Stiemie convinced Renken to place the R400 000 he kept at his home in a safety deposit box at the bank. The box, known as a deed box , would then be locked and stored in the bank s treasury vault for safekeeping.
