I m pretty sure if one were to retrieve articles written 10 years ago on the matric dropout/failure rate around this time of year, one would be able to publish them verbatim and they would still be relevant. It boggles my mind that we can t put together a cohesive education system to ensure the future of our country. What s the problem? Don t we have the expertise, resources or will to provide our children with the education required to enable them to become productive citizens with the skills necessary to build this beautiful country of ours into the reality of the vision of our great past leaders. Don t we have the educational experts, don t we have the staff capable of teaching our children, don t we have the resources or is it a case of we really don t care? The difference between the affluent and poorer schools is just management. The majority of affluent schools have sound management systems and dedicated staff committed to their chosen profession, teaching. The poorer schools are left to their own devices and get very little support from the dysfunctional department. These schools are in the majority in our country and add to this that the vast majority of our children are taught in a foreign language by non-English speaking teachers, then one begins to understand the hopelessness of the situation. Our only hope is that the DA wins the 2019 elections and fixes this mess, but in saying this my hope is that it brings in the experts to fix it. The Western Cape has shown good results from an administrative perspective, but the jury is still out from an educational perspective. Should the mess that s our educational system continue as it is the sad reality will be that only six out of 10 of this year s Grade 1s will reach Grade 12 and then only four out of those six will pass matric.
