ANC Deputy Secretary General Jessie Duarte Picture: Sunday Times/Daylin Paul. The African National Congress (ANC) chose Unity in Action as one of the key themes of the party s 105th birthday celebrations as the party aims to reclaim lost ground following a number of challenges and setbacks . Writing in the Daily Maverick on Thursday deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte said the ANC had been hit by a number of electoral setbacks in certain key areas which were fuelled by dissatisfaction with the progress in the fight against crime corruption and the creation of jobs . We also did ourselves no favours when internal party battles played out in the public space on the eve of the polls she continued. This dented citizens confidence in the ANC and it is imperative that we reclaim lost ground as a matter of urgency. 2017 s task would be rebuilding the trust of the electorate Duarte wrote. This would require rejuvenation of our movement and a return to the core values upon which the party was founded . It is only through returning to these founding values that we will be able to realize the aspirations of our people towards a South Africa that is united non-racial non-sexist democratic and prosperous.
