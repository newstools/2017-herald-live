UNICEF representative in Yemen, Meritxell Relano, addresses a press conference in Sanaa, Yemen Picture: Khaled Abdullah / Reuters Nearly 1 400 children have been killed, hundreds more injured and many schools closed by the war in Yemen, the UN children&#8217;s fund said on Wednesday. &#8220;Attacks on civilian areas continue to kill and injure scores of children in Yemen,&#8221; said UNICEF&#8217;s representative in Yemen, Meritxell Relano. &#8220;Instead of learning, children are witnessing death, war and destruction,&#8221; she added, warning that the actual casualty toll was likely to be much higher than the verified figures. More than 7 300 people have been killed in Yemen since a Saudi-led coalition intervened against Iran-backed Huthi rebels in March 2015 in support of the government. Relano called on all parties in the conflict to protect children and stop attacks on schools. The plea follows a coalition air strike near a school in rebel-held northern Yemen on Tuesday that medics and a local official said killed five people, including two children. UNICEF said that it had confirmed the death of one child in the strike. &#8220;Schools have to be zones of peace at all times, a sanctuary where children can learn, grow, play and be safe,&#8221; Relano said. &#8220;Children should never risk their lives only to attend school.&#8221; She said that nearly 2 000 schools in Yemen can no longer be used because they have been damaged, destroyed or are used as shelters or for military purposes.
