Thandi and her newborn calf. Picture: Supplied Thandi the Sunshine Coast rhino who became a global anti-poaching icon after she miraculously survived having her horn hacked off five years ago has given birth to a second calf. The birth of the as yet unnamed calf came at a time when family and friends were mourning the death of Kariega Game Reserve founder Colin Rushmere 10 days ago. Rushmere&#8217;s son Mark said today they did not even know Thandi was pregnant. She had recently disappeared and they feared she may have been hit a second time by poachers. &#8220;For all we know the calf was born on the same day Dad died we could not find her for a while and were worried. &#8220;It is all very symbolic.&#8221; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
