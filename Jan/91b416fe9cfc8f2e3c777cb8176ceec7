BIRTHDAY BASH: President Jacob Zuma raises his fists as he is welcomed by Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and national executive committee chairwoman Baleka Mbete at the ANC s 105th birthday rally at Orlando Stadium in Soweto Pictures: DAYLIN PAUL People should refrain from discussing the party s succession process, President Jacob Zuma said in a surprise appearance yesterday at the ANC s 105th anniversary celebrations in KwaDukuza on the KwaZulu-Natal north coast. Zuma, who was in the area for the funeral of a relative and had not planned to address the crowd, said there were people obsessed with positions, and we know the reason why . We want this to be discussed during the policy conference in June, he said. Let us refrain from discussing succession. That time will come. We re not saying people shouldn t express themselves this is a democracy. But how you express yourself tells what kind of a leader you are. There are leaders who unite and leaders who sow division. Zuma emphasised the issue of unity, saying it was imperative for the party s members to be more united. Also present were ANC treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize and Home Affairs Minister Malusi Gigaba.
