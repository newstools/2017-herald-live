The third edition of the Baakens Food Truck Friday is heading for the valley next Friday January 20, having quickly established itself as a fun, foodie meeting place for families, friends and visitors. This outdoor evening market will again be operating outside WERK in Lower Valley Road in the Baakens Valley. It will open to the public at 4pm and end at 9pm. A total of 18 owner-operated food trucks will fill the street and sell produce ranging from gourmet burgers to artisanal ice lollies, freshly squeezed juices, vegetarian meals, Asian food, coffee, Halaal cuisine and more. For lovers of craft beer, wine and gin, bar facilities will be available at Fratelli Foods and the Richmond Hill Brewing Company. Organisers Jan du Plessis, of design and building collaborative WERK, and Grant Foong, of Foong s Asian Street Food, have seen their vision come to life. They believe the event showcases the talents of local foodies and artists while building a sense of community within the city. According to Foong, the market has a picnic vibe and members of the public are encouraged to bring along their picnic blankets and camping chairs. In the event of poor weather the show will motor on, with limited seating space available inside the WERK warehouse. The event is held in one of the city s most under-utilised public open spaces and as such there is no entry fee, Foong said. All meals are capped at R45 so market-goers can experience a wide range of freshly prepared fare without breaking the bank. Come and support your favourite mobile foodies and enjoy the beautiful valley sunset while experiencing the very best in Eastern Cape street food, Foong said. Activities appeal to all members of the family and include pony and pedal go-kart rides, henna art, balloon animals and a diverse line-up of local musicians.
