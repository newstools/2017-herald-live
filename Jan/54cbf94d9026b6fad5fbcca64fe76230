54 girls had babies last year and more already expecting A staggering 54 girls were pregnant at Port Elizabeth s Booysen Park High School last year, an increasingly prevalent trend fuelled by drugs, alcohol, peer pressure and desperation for income. So far this year, at least four girls have been found to be pregnant as the school battles to curb reckless sexual behaviour which, it said, severely affected education. Principal Ivan Martins said that last year the school had the highest number of teen pregnancies he had seen in his more than 20 years there. Booysen Park High caters for children from Booysen Park, Jacksonville, Timothy Valley and surrounding informal settlements. The school was one of several affected by weeks of closure due to ongoing protests last year. Of the 1 174 pupils registered at the school last year, 652 were girls. While only 39% of its matriculants passed last year, Martins said pregnancies were not the only reason for the poor performance. There are a number of factors which contribute towards [pregnancies], including drug and alcohol abuse, families with little to no income gaining some financial assistance through child grants, and sometimes these girls just want some attention, he said. A former pupil and teacher at the school, Martins said that not too long ago teenage pregnancies were isolated incidents there. But the number increased in 2014 and now pregnancies at the school had become the norm. Some of these girls are pressured tremendously, often by gang members who convince these girls they are in love with them. Also, if pupils have not fallen pregnant, they are seen as outcasts by their peers.
