A warrant of arrest was issued yesterday for a Port Elizabeth businessman accused of fraud after he sent a Whats App message to the investigating officer declaring his innocence and then failed to pitch for court. In the bizarre message, Sipho Sowazi, 49, of Bluewater Bay, also said he felt unwell and that his lawyer was unavailable for the next month. He then signed off with God bless you . Sowazi, the owner of Hebi Engineering and Projects CC, is accused of defrauding Port Elizabeth engineer Anthony Scholtz out of nearly R300 000 after the two formed a joint business venture in February 2015. While it was agreed that Sowazi would use his firm s empowerment status to source and secure work, Scholtz s more established Bracus Engineering CC would provide all the equipment, labour and infrastructure. Clients would then be invoiced by Hebi, who would, in turn, pay Bracus. The profits on the transactions would be split on a 60%-40% basis between Hebi and Bracus. The state alleges Bracus was often short-paid by Sowazi, who always had an excuse for the shortfall. By August 2015, Bracus was already allegedly owed R80 000. At that stage, Bracus was ready to complete a number of orders for delivery to Transnet on behalf of Hebi, for which payment to the total value of R279 890 was expected in the near future, the charge sheet reads. To pacify Scholtz and persuade him to continue with their arrangement, Sowazi offered to open a new bank account into which future payments in respect of engineering contracts would be received. In terms of this new arrangement, Scholtz s wife would have co-signing authority and full access to that account. The objective was that Scholtz would be able to see when payments were received and to have peace of mind.
