NMB speaker Jonathan Lawack Picture: Brian Witbooi More than four months into the job, some Nelson Mandela Bay councillors are still battling to serve their communities as they have yet to receive proper office equipment. Although most ward councillors have the tools for their jobs, some are struggling as the offices burnt during violent protests in 2014 as well as others that were vandalised have yet to be restored. According to speaker Jonathan Lawack, the municipality received an insurance payout for two offices, but his office was battling to get hold of the money to buy new equipment and furniture. The insurance paid out for two offices in Uitenhage and PE. The money was paid to our facility management department, but we are struggling to get hold of it, Lawack said. Kwazakhele s Ward 24 councillor Kholekile Boqwana said his office was torched twice by angry residents. We have been without office furniture ever since, he said. Ward 41 (Joe Slovo) councillor Simphiwe Tyukana said he used his personal laptop as he did not have an office computer.
