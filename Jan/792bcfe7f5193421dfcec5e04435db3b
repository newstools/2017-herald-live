ROYAL TOUCH: The Queen Mary arrives at the Port Elizabeth harbour in 2015. The liner is due here again on Sunday Picture: EUGENE COETZEE After almost two years since her last visit, the RMS Queen Mary II will grace the shores of Port Elizabeth when she arrives on Sunday. The passenger liner, which stopped in Port Elizabeth in April 2015, is due to dock at the harbour at about 7am, and will remain until the evening, when she departs for Reunion Island. As the liner has hundreds of passengers, the stopover will be a boost for Nelson Mandela Bay s economy. Her arrival forms part of the 2016-17 passenger liner season, which started in October and will continue until April. The liner is one of 17 scheduled to dock in Port Elizabeth this season. Port manager Rajesh Dana said the growth of the cruise sector benefited the economy of the province. Transnet National Ports Authority, working closely with Nelson Mandela Bay tourism, is committed to ensuring that the passenger liner season reinforces the attractiveness of the metro as a growing tourist destination, with world-class port infrastructure and services, Dana said. The Queen sports a variety of facilities, including a casino and the first-ever planetarium on a ship. Nelson Mandela Bay tourism chief executive Mandlakazi Skefile said 14 600 passengers and 5 000 crew members would stop over during the liner season.
