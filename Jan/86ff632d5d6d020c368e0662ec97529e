The assault cases against two ANC Nelson Mandela Bay councillors have been postponed to March for further investigation. Andile Lungisa and Gamalihleli Maqula, accused of assaulting two DA councillors in a council brawl in November last year, appeared one after the other in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate&#8217;s Court on Tuesday morning. The prosecution said it was still awaiting one witness statement in respect of Lungisa, while video footage was still outstanding in the case against Maqula. It is alleged that Lungisa smashed a glass jug filled with water over DA councillor Rano Kayser s head, while Maqula allegedly assaulted DA Chief Whip Werner Senekal by stabbing him in the back with a sharp object. The two men are due back in court on March 30. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
