Her mother was devastated. &#8220;There is not much to say anymore. I just want to know why he [allegedly] did it. He must tell me now &#8221; she said. &#8220;I have taken a tranquiliser so I am numb&#8230;I&#8217;m feeling numb and my psychologist friend is taking good care of me. I am now waiting for the police to come and see me.&#8221; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
