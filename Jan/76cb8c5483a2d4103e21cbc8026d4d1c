Some principals at former Model C schools are being bullied by district officials to accept more pupils with warnings about their jobs being on the line according to the Federation of Governing Bodies of South African Schools (Fedsas). At the same time experts and parents warn that if too many non-fee-paying pupils are pushed into functional schools wealthy parents who subsidise the underprivileged pupils will leave government schools ultimately leaving less money to keep schools working. Fedsas Gauteng representative Dr Jean van Rooyen said the way principals were spoken to amounted to bullying and unfair labour practice. Three court rulings have given the government the final say over school capacity but require officials to work together with parents on problems. One former Model C school said 27% of its pupils were unable to pay fees. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
