Vacquero Augustine Picture: AMIR CHETTY Vacquero Augustine, 18, will be spoilt for choice as to where to study after receiving responses from at least three top universities. Vacquero, of Malabar Extension 6, was elated on learning that he had attained six distinctions in the 2016 matric examinations. Matriculating from Malabar s Woolhope Secondary School, he must now choose between Wits University (mechanical or electrical engineering, or information systems) and NMMU (computer sciences), and awaits feedback from the University of Cape Town about his application for medicine or mechanical engineering. He achieved distinctions in mathematics, Afrikaans first additional language, history, life orientation, life sciences and physical sciences. Last night was nerve-racking. I couldn t sleep. I got my results off the internet, but it [didn t show] the percentages, only the distinctions, Vacquero said. He moved from Schauderville to Malabar aged three, and was five when his father died. That period, he said, was extremely difficult, but he needed to be strong for his mother, Glynda, 52, and brother Vinzenzo, 17. Glynda said: I think his motivation was the struggles he had. Vacquero helps out at the DeNico Family Market to support his family. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
