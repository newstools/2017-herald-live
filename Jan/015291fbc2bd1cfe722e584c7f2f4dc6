Former SABC chairman, Ben Ngubane, answers questions in parliament on Friday Picture: Esa Alexander Former SABC chairman Ben Ngubane was lambasted on Twitter as he answered questions at a parliamentary inquiry into the fitness of the SABC board to hold office on Friday. Ngubane was defiant as he faced probing questions about the embattled state broadcaster which he took credit for having saved from going bankrupt. He also defended controversial executive Hlaudi Motsoeneng whom he said had been employed for his skills not his qualifications. Motsoeneng was found in a public protector report to have lied about his matric status. Ngubane rejected an allegation by former acting CEO Phil Molefe that it was he who had recommended a massive salary increase for Motsoeneng. Twitter users lapped up the verbal sparring in Parliament and it did not take long before Ben Ngubane started trending. TVwithThinus tweeted: SHOCKER.
