There are always two sides of the coin, but the dubious mistake in the buyout clause when Keagan Dolly signed a new contract with Mamelodi Sundowns in August 2015 is unjustifiable and suspicious ( Motsepe tells of bribe theory over Dolly buyout millions , January 11). Patrice Motsepe used the press conference to ease any contradiction that could arise surrounding the player contract and insisted the club had the best interests of the player at heart. But with the aftermath revelations, however, tension is ratcheting up for a bitter transfer wrangle over the player s ambitious move overseas. The bitter dispute over a player (Dolly) has descended into endless vitriol between his camp and Downs management over the buyout clause in the contract. The club s actions infuriated the player s camp because the club made too many changes to the contract, according to the player s agent. Indeed the clause was restored to favour the club, but the player s camp benefits less all this war is about money! The acrimony between the two factions could potentially compromise the player s ambition to seek greener pasture overseas. It s understandable that offers are coming through, but the legal battle could jeopardise or delay the move. There s a conspiracy theory that the forces of market saturation and investment consortia take advantage of the financial weakness of an agent to secure the rights to sell the player to the best bidder. Sundowns hold all the cards and the player s fate is in their hands. They should do the right thing if they want Dolly to realise his dream.
