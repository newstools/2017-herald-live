DAILY CHORE: Gertrude Bonakele collects water from a neighbour s tap, a task she has been carrying out every day for the six months she has been without water at her Joe Slovo house Picture: JUDY DE VEGA A grandmother and the five children she looks after have been without water for six months after a road construction project damaged underground water pipes. The damage initially caused flooding around her Joe Slovo shack, but instead of fixing the problem, the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality cut off the supply to the outside tap. It has been a battle since August for Gertrude Bonakele, 54, to get the city to reconnect her to the system. She claims to be the only one in Mafu Street without running water. Bonakele, who stays with her five grandchildren, relies on her neighbours to be able to fill up her 25-litre bucket every day. Workmen dug a big hole in front of my yard and that is when my problems started. At first my yard was flooded. As a result, I had to move my shack twice, Bonakele said.. As if that was not enough, my tap went dry. She called the municipality to alert it to the problem, but said she had battled to get through. She also reported the matter to Ward 41 councillor Simphiwe Tyukana. Bonakele said it pained her to see thousands of litres of clean water flowing down the streets. Last week, The Herald reported that there were massive pools of water in front of residents homes in Joe Slovo due to an underground leak. Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said officials would contact Bonakele to check the problem, ascertain the magnitude and solve it. We will also check why there has been a delay in responding to the issue, Mniki said. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
