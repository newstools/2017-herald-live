The final countdown has begun for thousands of anxious matriculants to discover the outcome of the culmination of their 12-year school careers. To ensure they get the news they cannot wait to get their hands on throughout Nelson Mandela Bay and beyond, The Herald subscription supervisor Kenneth McWire said that in addition to the street vendors who would be selling newspapers on their regular corners, others would be stationed at strategic hotspots. These would include the front of The Herald offices at Newspaper House in Baakens Street, Central, The Herald print plant at 640 Cape Road in Hunter s Retreat, and the KwaNobuhle Shell service station in Matanzima Road, Uitenhage, to cater for the demand. There are 38 000 newspapers being printed 10 000 of which will be sold through street vendors, which is about 6 000 more than usual, McWire said. The order for our agents and big retailers has also been doubled. He said despite the demand for the printed matric results decreasing slightly following the Department of Education s decision to print exam numbers as opposed to matriculants names, newspaper sales on the day remained notably higher when compared to the rest of the year.
