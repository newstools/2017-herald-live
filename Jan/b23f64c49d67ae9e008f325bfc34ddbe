Mmusi Maimane with Israeli prime minister Benjamin Netanyahu Picture: Supplied The claim by the Palestinian embassy in Pretoria that it was not informed about DA leader Mmusi Maimane s visit to Israel and Palestine last week was simply unfortunate and inaccurate . A war of words between the DA and the Palestinian embassy escalated yesterday, the embassy suggesting that the DA had been disingenuous in suggesting that Maimane was meeting leaders of both Israel and Palestine during his visit on Thursday. The embassy of the State of Palestine would like to point out that the DA did not inform the embassy about Maimane s visit to the State of Palestine and that the embassy became aware of the DA leader s visit through the media it said. The embassy also charged that no Palestinian officials or leaders were scheduled to meet Maimane during the visit. However, the DA denied this stating that it had a confirmed meeting with Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas, but that it had been cancelled at the last minute. DA spokesman Phumzile van Damme said the party had also informed South Africa s embassy in Ramallah of the meeting and had invited the South African ambassador to join the meeting. We visited the Palestinian Territories met human rights activists visited refugees in Ramallah and met business community [leaders] and investors who are building the new Palestine despite the ongoing conflict. We did not inform the Palestinian Authority embassy in South Africa before our visit; we were not required to do so as South Africans do not require visas to visit [there]. We communicated directly with the president s office Van Damme said. However it is revealing that the embassy s statement says there was an instruction issued not to meet the DA.
