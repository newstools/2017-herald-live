Brett D @brettddunbar tweeted an image of the sign on the Main Road bridge saying: @Radio702 @ewnupdates @News24 someone is clearly not happy with FNB. N1 north in JHB . The banner added a version of what the banks acronym could stand for: Flippin Negligent Bankers . @Radio702 @ewnupdates @News24 someone is clearly not happy with FNB.
