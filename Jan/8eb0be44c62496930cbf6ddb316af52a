Nicole Kidman still hopes for a baby at age 49 Nicole Kidman still hopes for another baby at the age of 49, despite several heartbreaks. The Australian actress, who has four children including two with her husband Keith Urban, spoke openly about her hopes as she admitted she thought she would never be able to give birth due to fertility problems. Touching on her previous experiences, she said she believed her chances were getting slimmer and slimmer before the couple s youngest daughter Faith, five, was born through a surrogate. Now, she has renewed hope. She said: I still have the faintest hope that something may happen to me this year. My grandmother gave birth to my mother at 49. I would be beyond happy and welcome it with open arms. Her comments come despite the fact that Kidman, who has been nominated for Best Supporting Actress in the Golden Globes for her role in Lion in which she plays an adoptive mother, has experienced ups and downs when it has come to conceiving.
