The Bhisho Legislature s education portfolio committee has expressed shock at the state of readiness of schools in the Cacadu district. Led by chairman Mxolisi Dimaza, the committee met education stakeholders and parents in the district offices in Cacadu on Friday. We want to check what went wrong in this [Cacadu] district as it used to be one of the best performing districts in the province, Dimaza said. Pointing fingers at individuals will not assist us, but we must get all hands on deck in trying to find feasible solutions to this problem. Acting district director Thobeka Zibula, when giving an overview of the state of schools in the district, said the pass rate had deteriorated from 63.9% in 2014 to 46.2% in 2015 and 49.5% last year. Challenges included: The non-delivery of textbooks; Glue given as part of pupil-teacher support materials being used as a drug; The non-availability of scholar transport in most schools; Pupils not having birth certificates or identity documents; The late admission of pupils; The high number of small schools that need to be closed down; A shortage of teachers; and A shortage of teachers for critical subjects like maths and science. Zibula said the department was employing foreign nationals who were good with maths and science, but only gave them a three-month contract. Provincial education chief director Phila Ngqumba told the meeting that the department was unable to find solutions to the problems alone and urged all stakeholders to come together. He said one of the reasons why textbooks were not delivered was that orders were only placed in December. The political leadership must come with solutions to the problem of budget allocations, Ngqumba said. Dimaza criticised the Department of Education for poor planning.
