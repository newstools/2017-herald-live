Shows the injured dolphin being cared for at Kabaljous Beach Picture: NSRI Jeffreys Bay A stranded dolphin that washed ashore on the Kabeljous Beach in Jeffreys Bay at the weekend had to be euthanised due to its severe injuries. On Saturday, there were two reports of stranded dolphins in the town. Jeffreys Bay NSRI station commander Ernie Schmidt, who responded to both strandings, said the first was reported by lifeguard Paul Makupula on Main Beach shortly before 8am. Schmidt and his wife and fellow NSRI member, Elaine, said when they arrived at Main Beach the dolphin had been placed back in the ocean. It appears it was a juvenile bottlenose dolphin. We stayed in the area for about 90 minutes in case there was another beaching. On leaving, we briefed the lifeguards not to try to put the dolphins back in the water, but to rather call the NSRI to activate the Stranding Network, he said. Just before 4pm, lifeguard Tim Baard reported another stranded dolphin at Kabeljous Beach. The striped dolphin had severe wounds on its side and back. Dr Greg Hoffmeyer, of Port Elizabeth s Bayworld, arranged for vet Dr Kathy Bezuidenhout, who is based at the local Oribi Animal Hospital, to assist and examine the animal. Mike Meyer of the Department of Environmental Affairs was also roped in to assist, Schmidt said. After examination by the vet it was decided that the wounds were too severe for it to live if it were put back into the sea, he said. The dolphin was transported with a team of carers to the animal hospital where after all attempts to save it were exhausted, it was euthanised .
