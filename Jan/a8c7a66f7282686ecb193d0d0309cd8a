GOOD ARTIST: A proud Francis Frankie Nienhuis with an earlier catch Pearson matric pupil drowns while spearfishing off Cape Recife It was just a matter of a few minutes and he was gone. That was Eugene van Wyngaardt s emotionally charged description of the tragic death of Pearson High School pupil Francis Frankie Nienhuis, who is believed to have drowned while spearfishing at Thunderbolt Reef off Cape Recife in Port Elizabeth early on Saturday. Van Wyngaardt, 48, and the 18-year-old pupil, from Greenbushes, were free diving at the popular site when the incident occurred at about 7am. While the exact cause of death has not yet been established, Van Wyngaardt, who has 26 years of free diving and spearfishing experience, suspects Nienhuis suffered a blackout. His body was recovered not long after the alarm had been raised. Police have opened an inquest docket. The incident sparked an extensive response by various emergency services, including the National Sea Rescue Institute (NSRI), which was activated at 7.47am. A number of other spearfishermen and divers were in the area at the time and also responded to the emergency. Bay NSRI station commander Ian Gray said ocean conditions at the time were good. Van Wyngaardt said Nienhuis was a novice spearfisherman but a very capable swimmer. He said the pupil s interest in the sport had surfaced during a recent trip to Plettenberg Bay. Frankie was a friend of my daughter and he expressed a strong interest in spearfishing, Van Wyngaardt said. I have been coaching, training him, and trying to teach him all I know about the sport. I feel absolutely devastated by what happened. This is a total shock.
