SEASON REVIEW: Councillors Andrew Whitfield and Siyasanga Sijadu at the report-back Picture: EUGENE COETZEE Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip expects a huge overtime bill as municipal staff put in very long hours to ensure the city had a successful summer season. Officials from the public health, safety and security, and sports, recreation, arts and culture departments had to work overtime last month, with some on duty as early as 5am, Trollip said. But the bill would be worth it as the city had a world-class record summer season, he said. The cleaning staff started work from 5am and left after midnight. Security staff worked weekends, some worked 24/7, Trollip said. Municipal spokesman Mzobanzi Jikazana said the exact figure for the overtime bill would only be known at the end of the month. Trollip said overtime had been budgeted for. If you pay overtime and have the results that we had, it is worth every single cent, he said.
