Footage of a 92-year-old Chinese woman reportedly kept for years by her son in a pigsty has incited an online firestorm, as China grapples with the question of how to provide for its increasingly ageing population. The woman, surnamed Yang, was kept in a pigsty by her son and daughter-in-law, who did not provide her with enough food or clothing and constantly beat and scolded her, according to the Nanguo Morning News of the southern Guangxi region. A video of the woman s appalling living conditions appeared on China s Twitterlike social media platform Weibo. I cannot see things, Yang said feebly, inching herself towards the bars of her enclosure. Her son and daughter-in-law claimed Yang had voluntarily moved into the doorless, fence-and-stone-enclosed kitchen beside their house, denying that she was kept in a pigsty, the newspaper said. Photos of a rag-clad Yang being rescued by local government officials appeared on Weibo after the video went viral earlier this month. She is now being treated at a hospital, but has not fully recovered. The videos and photos infuriated Chinese who accused her children of inhumane and animalistic behaviour, saying that the son and daughter-in-law will be treated in the same way by their children when they get old . China s population is ageing, and weaknesses in its elder care system have left hundreds of millions in dire straits. The problem is even more severe in the country s vast rural areas, where elderly people are often left alone while their children migrate to big cities for jobs. In 2013, China passed an elderly rights law which included provisions that required children to regularly visit their parents, among others. The country now has more than 212 million people over the age of 60, according to the National Bureau of Statistics.
