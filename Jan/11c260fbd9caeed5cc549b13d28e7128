The former Mamelodi Sundowns star was delighted after delivering a man of the match performance in his first start for Guimaraes since arriving in Portugal in July. He had previously come off the bench twice. He now believes he is destined for great things. &#8220;I&#8217;m happy and God is great, man,&#8221; Zungu said from Portugal. &#8220;With more game time like this I should be able to do more and go further. I&#8217;ve been working so hard and the team provided a lot of medical attention.&#8221; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
