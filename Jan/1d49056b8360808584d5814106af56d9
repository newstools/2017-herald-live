Mapane confirmed the incident, and said he was driving the Bentley when it was deliberately scratched with a key but would not be drawn into commenting on whether it belonged to Nyovest. My man do you know with R300 000 you can get a new car? The repairs to the Bentley are crazy he said. Douglasdale police spokeswoman Captain Mpho Kgasoane said investigations were ongoing. However she could not divulge any details about the cost of the damage. I can confirm that [a] suspect was arrested and appeared in court on December 19. I can t give any details about the cost or damage to the car she said. Nyovest s management could not be reached for comment. Shortly after the incident the rapper expressed his disappointment about the incident on social media, asking: Why do [they] have to do this?
