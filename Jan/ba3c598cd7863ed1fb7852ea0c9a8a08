Investigators find ceiling alarm sensors sabotaged before R2-million worth of items taken from iStore The sophisticated, brazen burglary of a high-end IT store at the Walmer Park Shopping Centre last week still has the police baffled. The biggest mystery is that there is no structural breach of the complex s roof even though the thieves gained entry to the iStore from the ceiling after closing time and emptied the vault of almost R2-million worth of Apple iPhones. The burglary was discovered on Monday morning last week when the store manageress opened up and found that about 150 iPhone cellphones and gadgets had been stolen from the strongroom at the back of the store. A preliminary investigation revealed that the burglars broke into the shop on Sunday night. Walmer Park centre portfolio manager Leonie Scheepers said yesterday: The safe had been cleaned out except for two cellular devices which, incidentally, were the only two devices which had tracking monitors in them. According to in-store CCTV footage, the safe was burgled at approximately 11pm as a partial image of a suspect coming through the ceiling in the strong-room was noted. Scheepers said alarm sensors in the ceiling had been sabotaged and did not activate during the burglary.
