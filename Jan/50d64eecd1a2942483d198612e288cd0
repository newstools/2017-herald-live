Pictures: Brian Witbooi For the first time, the PPC Imaginarium Awards has teamed up with the ArtEC Community Art Centre in Port Elizabeth to host a pop-up exhibition showcasing artworks from the Eastern Cape s emerging creatives. The exhibition is open to the public and will run until February 10 with a range of artworks entered into the annual awards competition. The PPC Imaginarium Awards is an art and design competition in which emerging artists and designers are challenged to demonstrate their knack for innovation by incorporating the medium of concrete into their respective disciplines. Now in its third year, the Business Arts South Africa award-winning competition has prize money totaling R500000. It also gives finalists the opportunity of exhibiting their works at a number of auspicious galleries and major events such as the Turbine Art Fair and 100% Design South Africa as part of its annual travelling exhibition. The exhibition in Port Elizabeth is a first for the competition. It is important to us that the competition has national representation, which is why we have judging stations in Port Elizabeth, Bloemfontein, Durban, Cape Town, Johannesburg and Pretoria, said PPC s Daniel van der Merwe. Expanding our exhibition calendar to include Port Elizabeth is exciting for us and we hope to continue to support and grow the creative industries in the Eastern Cape in the future. Gallery hours are 9am to 4pm on weekdays. Inquiries: Zinzi Mabuso (041) 585-3641. For more information on the PPC Imaginarium Awards, visit www.ppcimaginarium.co.za.
