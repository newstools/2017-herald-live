REFUSE COLLECTION: Partially filled green plastic municipal refuse bags line the side of Stanford Road near Jacksonville in Port Elizabeth s northern areas Picture: JUDY DE VEGA What is the story with regard to the light green refuse bags that line our streets at odd intervals? Clearly there is rubble in the bags from cleaning the sidewalks/streets, but not one bag is filled to even one 10th of its capacity. What a waste of ratepayers money! Is it too much of an effort for the street cleaners to walk one metre to collect the rubble from a fellow street cleaner and at least to fill a bag to capacity (or thereabouts)? A bag half full would even be better than what I witnessed on the way to work one morning last week. There were at least 10 bags along one section of Overbaakens Street, Fairview, where you could clearly see that no effort had been made to fill a bag. This is not the first time I have seen such blatant wastage. Is it too much to ask that some sort of supervision be taken over this activity? Clearly someone is fast asleep or just does not care that money is literally being thrown away. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
