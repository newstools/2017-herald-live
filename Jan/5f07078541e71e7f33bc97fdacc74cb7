Pastor Brendan Olivier Even if someone was shot dead right in front of me, I will never testify in court. This chilling statement by the mother of a gangster mowed down in the heart of Port Elizabeth s gangland was made as the pastor whose testimony was pivotal to her son s killer s conviction is still jobless and in hiding eight years later abandoned by those who had promised to help him if he testified. Pastor Brendan Olivier, 47, and his family lost their home and most of their possessions after they took flight following death threats. They have spent the last eight years penniless and on the run, and are now living in a state-provided prefab structure with no water or electricity services and no toilet. One of Olivier s close relatives was murdered in retaliation for his testimony later, according to the pastor. Another witness who was crucial to the conviction, Esau Uithaler, 34, was shot dead on his way to church in October 2015 just two weeks after coming out of hiding and returning to the northern areas. Gang member Angelo Dakota Hendricks, 27, died in Olivier s arms in May 2009. Of the four witnesses to the hit, two had refused to testify. Hendricks s mother, Benita Bokbaard, 54, speaking from her Helenvale home, just a few hundred metres from where her son died, said she had endured four years of hell during the trial. I agree there was justice for my son, but I am heartsore about what happened to the witnesses, she said.
