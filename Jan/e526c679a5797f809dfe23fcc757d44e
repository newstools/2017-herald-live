Addressing the gathering, Neubert expressed confidence in the Eastern Cape s growth potential. This event is not only a celebration of Toyota Industrial Equipment in the Eastern Cape and of our commitment to building partnerships for life, but also an opportunity for us to celebrate the rich heritage of this region, he said.
