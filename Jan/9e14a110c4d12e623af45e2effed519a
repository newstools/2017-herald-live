HELPING HAND: Rhodes University honours student Sinenhlanhla Bhengu, 21 Picture: Supplied Rhodes student s outreach programme helps pupils in village Fresh from a holiday where she helped struggling pupils improve their maths marks, a Rhodes University honours student will look at new entrepreneurship projects she can undertake to continue supporting her family. Sinenhlanhla Bhengu, 21, born and raised in the village of Oakford, north of Durban, uses her free time between studying and attending classes to help and mentor others. In 2015, Bhengu started a community outreach programme called Young Geniuses in her hometown, which she uses to teach English and public speaking to high school pupils during the June and December holidays. I also started a midnight tuckshop at Rhodes called Midnight Munchies, which I run during exam periods as a side business, the economics major said, adding that the business was successful and made a substantial profit. Bhengu s vision is to improve the lives of South Africans by educating them to be critical thinkers through participation rather than observation while also thinking out of the box. I am passionate about social entrepreneurship, she said. The former Sacred Heart Secondary School pupil credits her mother for her motivation and ambitions. My family s circumstances motivate me, she said.
