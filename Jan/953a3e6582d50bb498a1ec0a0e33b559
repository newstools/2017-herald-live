Piet Bredenhann manages aal Dam which is part of the system that provides a third of the country&#8217;s water Picture: Madelene Cronje Ever wonder what happens behind the scenes when you twist open the tap to release a stream of fresh cool water? Here&#8217;s a hint there are no water gnomes sprites or nymphs involved. Instead teams of hard-working men and women strategise carefully to keep water flowing in the midst of the country&#8217;s three-year-long drought. At the Vaal Dam which is part of the system that provides a third of the country&#8217;s water manager Piet Bredenhann leads this operation. This drought ranks as one of the worst dry periods we have had he says. Bredenhann 56 manages the Upper Vaal which includes the Potchefstroom Boskop Rietfontein Lakeside dams and linked canals. To keep the water flowing he works with 88 staff members in administrative civil mechanical and electrical departments. The Vaal Dam is making steady progress with its water levels up again this week. On Monday the dam was 63.2% full up from 59.2% at the beginning of last week according to the Department of Water and Sanitation&#8217;s weekly dams report. For Bredenhann however there is little time to celebrate. His days are busy and without routine as he tends to various crises along the Vaal&#8217;s network particularly in recent months when dam levels dropped to a dangerous 26%. If the dam is empty there&#8217;s always stress. We have to supply Rand Water [Johannesburg Water] or Gauteng comes to a standstill. There&#8217;s a lot of pressure if you are unable to supply water to the people that need it though it&#8217;s not your fault. If you can&#8217;t get it [done] in one way you have to find another way. Bredenhann dressed casually in jeans and a red and blue checked shirt brushes off praise about his delicate daily balancing acts however saying every job had its challenges. He speaks of the budget constraints red tape and staff shortages he battles as run-of-the-mill issues all managers face. He is also very quick to put the country&#8217;s current drought severe as it may be into perspective. For instance prior to the wet season in 1988 the dam was at 18% he says explaining that current water shortages are events that come and go as part of the El Ni o and La Ni a climate patterns. On Monday dams across the country were 54.2% full up from 52.8% last week. But the country is still entrenched in drought and tighter water restrictions are planned for example in Cape Town. Bredenhann says one of the most frustrating things he has to endure in this time of scarcity is water wasters. If you&#8217;re in the water industry and you know how precious water is [water wastage] makes you angry. But there&#8217;s nothing we can do. It&#8217;s not for us to police. We can put in place restrictions but municipalities must enforce it. His frustration speaks of his love for what he does. Bredenhann who is qualified as a mechanical engineer has been working with water for 25 years. To work in the water industry is very fulfilling. No person can live without water. To make a small contribution to look after this valuable resource makes a difference. Bredenhann enjoys a game of golf now and then and camping when time allows .
