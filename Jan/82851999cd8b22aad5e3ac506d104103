Kaveen Jimmy and his sister Renisha &#8211; whose brother Reshall died in a Ford Kuga when it caught alight last December Picture: Alon Skuy Lawyers for embattled car manufacturer Ford are insistent that they be given access to a police docket into the death of one of its consumers. Claudo Bollo of the law firm BBM which represents Ford told TMG Digital outside the Cape Town High Court on Wednesday morning that they were prepared for the matter. Ford launched an urgent court application in December to be granted access to all evidence contained in the inquest docket into the death of Reshall Jimmy. Jimmy 33 was burnt alive in his Ford Kuga in December 2015 while on holiday in the Wilderness in the Western Cape. Forensic investigators hired by the Jimmy family and police and insurance fire experts believe a wiring fault in the dashboard of his car led to his death. Ford claims the fire started at the rear of the car. Since Jimmy s death at least 44 other Ford Kugas have caught alight on South Africa s roads. At least nine of these have caught fire in January. Bollo speaking outside court said that they had gone the urgent application route because every day people are accusing our client of things . All we are seeking are the necessary documents to help us establish the cause of the fires. We need and want to get to the bottom of this. The matter is due to be heard later on Wednesday afternoon.
