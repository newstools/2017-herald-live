Laaiq Ah Shene, is delighted to be back at school. Picture: Judy de vega A year ago, little Laaiq Ah Shene was a far cry from the six-year-old boy who now enjoys school and could not wait to start learning. Laaiq famously graced the front page of The Herald last year after he was pictured trying to escape from his first day of class at Parkside Primary School. The little bundle of energy, who now enjoys school more than he did that day, said yesterday he could not wait to start learning the alphabet and how to count. I also like drawing and playtime, because I can make more friends, he said Laaiq said he was excited at the year ahead, saying he wanted to learn as much as he can, so I can be clever and do well in everything I do . Despite that emotional first day, The Herald reported a day later how Laaiq had found the second much easier to endure, acclimatising well to his surroundings and quickly making a few new mates. I don t remember much of what happened on that day last year I just know that my mom wanted to leave me here, and I didn t want her to leave, he said. Asked if he cried yesterday when he was dropped off at school, he said: Not a chance. His ambition is to become an astronaut. I ve seen many rockets taking people into space, and I want to be one of those people, he said. Class teacher Charmelle Munnik said Laaiq knew some of the children in the class from last year, so it was easy for him to make friends. We did a baseline assessment where we let the children introduce themselves. We also look at how they grip the pencil and they were also taught about the school rules, and I would say Laaiq handled himself quite well, Munnik said.
