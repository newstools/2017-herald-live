Rolene Strauss Picture: RAYMOND PRESTON Former Miss South Africa and Miss World Rolene Strauss has confirmed that she will be returning to university to complete her studies. Rolene gave birth about a week ago and has always maintained that despite the new addition to her life she would continue with her studies. This is her final year as a medical student and if you thought she would be taking some time off to adjust to having a baby around think again. Rolene confirmed to YOU magazine that she was ready to hit the books. I realise starting my studies again this Monday will take some adjustment but I have an incredible support network and I know it s more than possible. Together with the support from her family Rolene will have her longtime helper stay with her to help. Sjoe that s brave. G luck. &nbsp; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
