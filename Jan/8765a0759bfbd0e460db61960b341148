Dowwe Dolla is heading for Uitenhage&#8217;s Barkly East Theatre Picture: supplied Dowwe Dolla, South Africa s most loved dumb blonde for more than two decades now, is heading for Uitenhage s Barkly Street Theatre next month. And because social media is where everything is happening nowadays, it s only obvious that Dolla (played by Margit Meyer- Rodenbeck) will investigate this phenomenon. In the process of trying to understand the difference between Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Solitaire, Dolla discovers in the show why women still keep men around. She also explains the real secret behind a braai, which in turn leads to heavier topics such as trophy hunting, arachnophobia, white guilt and Hannibal Lecter. For the first time Ouma Dowe Dolla (also performed by Meyer-Rodenbeck) will make her debut on stage to give a more historical or perhaps hysterical perspective to everyday life in South Africa. The script and lyrics are by Jurgen Human, and music and direction by Emile Minnie. The laugh-a-minute show is 75 minutes long and no under 12s are permitted (language). The show will be at the Barkly Street Theatre on Thursday February 9 at 8pm. Tickets at R120 are available on (041)922-0575 or 082-809-4272.
