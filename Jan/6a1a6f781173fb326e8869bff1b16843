Picture: Supplied The smell of onions did not throw police off the trail of discovering dagga with a street value of R215 000 stuffed in a black bag at the weekend. Grahamstown police spokeswoman Captain Mali Govender said a woman, 38, was arrested on Sunday and will appear in the Grahamstown Magistrate&#8217;s Court on Monday on a charge of possession of drugs. &#8220;During a vehicle check point held by the cluster task team, dagga was sniffed out,&#8221; said Govender. &#8220;It was packed with onions to try and camouflage the smell. It was then wrapped in clothing.&#8221; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
