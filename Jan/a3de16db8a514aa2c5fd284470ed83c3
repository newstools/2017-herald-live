A spoof Nando s ad parodying the Ford Kuga recall has left some social media users hot under the collar. Twitter user Floyd Nkuna posted the ad on his timeline hours after car manufacturer Ford announced the recall on Monday of 4556 Ford Kuga 1.6l made between 2012 and 2014. #FordKuga pic.twitter.com/9xfjkD4wrB &mdash; Floyd Nkuna (@floyd_nkuna) January 16, 2017 Ford had been given an ultimatum by the National Consumer Commission after a meeting between senior Ford executives and commission lawyers last Friday. In the ad which looks similar to those used by the flame-grilled chicken outlet Nkuna says: If you thought Kuga was on fire you haven t tried our flame-grilled Peri-Peri chicken. He also makes a play on words with the line: Do you Recall the last time you had fire in your mouth. Some social media users lambasted the ad saying it was offensive and too soon . One note that someone died in one of those fires. Others however thought the ad was funny. The Kuga issue however had been the subject of memes in the run-up to the recall. #FordKuga The look when Ford Kuga park next to you pic.twitter.com/tytSUDDZgx &mdash; Sipho Ntuli (@siphon82) January 16, 2017 When you connect your Samsung Note 7 to your Ford Kuga&#39;s bluetooth pic.twitter.com/SBimOwboES &mdash; Ofentse (@Jazz_Nova) January 7, 2017 Nando s wasn&#8217;t immediately available for comment. In November last year Nkuna created another Nando&#8217;s spoof ad directed at former Eskom CEO Brian Molefe who cried after trying to explain his 19 visits to the Gupta family residence in Saxonwold by saying he had visited a shebeen there. One Twitter managed to conflate Molefe s tears with the Kuga issue.
