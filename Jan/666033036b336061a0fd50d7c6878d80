Picture: Brian Witbooi A two-year-old boy died while three others sustained injuries after their Missionvale home was guttered in a fire earlier today. The family were in their Colorado street home when a suspected electrical fault caused the house to go up in flames. The home, as well as two adjoining wooden establishments, was gutted in the flames. Three people, including the boy s mother and four-year-old sister sustained minor injuries. Another woman, who could not be identified, sustained 25% second degree burns to her face and back. According to a fire services official on the scene, fire services received a call about the incident at around 12:44pm, and immediately dispatched a vehicle to the scene. The official said that upon arrival, neighbours could be seen trying to put out the blaze using garden hoses and buckets of water. The official suspected faulty cables in the kitchen could have caused the fire, however he could not confirm this. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
