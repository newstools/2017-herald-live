The JSE started the week on a negative note as the all-share retreated in risk-off trade affecting banks retailers and financial stocks. All three sectors closed sharply lower, while rand hedges failed to capitalise on a softer rand. In contrast gold shares were in demand from safe-haven investors as market sentiment was overshadowed by US President Donald Trump s decision to shut US borders to refugees and others from seven largely Muslim countries. Sentiment was cautious amid rumours of a possible cabinet reshuffle by President Jacob Zuma, and a mooted commission of inquiry into South African banks. Markets were also unsettled after Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan earlier released an affidavit on the Gupta family, raising the spectre of a renewed struggle between Gordhan and the Guptas ahead of the budget speech on February 22. The JSE all-share index closed 0.59% lower at 52 660.9 points and the blue-chip Top 40 0.64%. Banks were 1.41% lower general retailers 1.4% and financial stocks 1.11%. Platinum shares lost 1.04% but the gold index added 3.62%. The all-share has started the year on a positive note and is up almost 4% more than the whole of last year s gains. But analysts said further growth was largely dependent on mining stocks. The MSCI emerging markets index is 6.2% higher in dollar terms and is likely to continue to do well if commodities do well. Analysts said if Trump kept to his promises on infrastructural spending it should be positive. However resources are always a tough call because the level of uncertainty is so high, one said. Standard Bank shed 2.21%, to R142.54, and FirstRand 1.65%. Other financials also remained under pressure. BusinessLIVE Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
