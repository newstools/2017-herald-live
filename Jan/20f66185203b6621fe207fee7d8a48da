Today we report that at least 54 girls were pregnant at Port Elizabeth s Booysen Park High School last year alone. As the schooling year began last week, teachers had already identified four pregnant girls. It is perhaps fair to conclude that the number will increase as the year progresses. While teenage pregnancies are not new in South Africa and elsewhere in the world, these figures are alarming and should be understood in the context of a bigger socioeconomic crisis in parts of our city. School principal Ivan Martins is at his wits end. Despite attempts to guide their pupils, the problem had worsened so much in the last three years that being pregnant in school had become the norm. In fact, Martins said, while teenage pregnancy was previously regarded as taboo, the tables have turned and those who have not fallen pregnant are somewhat regarded as outcasts by their peers. This signals a disturbing prevalence of risky sexual behaviour among youngsters. The situation is perhaps less about the school itself, but is indicative of a broader community problem, one where there is a complete breakdown of commonly held social norms meant to preserve the future of these children. Importantly, it raises a number of pertinent questions, chief among them the effectiveness of sex education in a country battling unacceptably high HIV/Aids infections. It suggests that the government and other social campaigns geared towards practicing safe sex are not effective enough to change reckless behaviour. The situation certainly calls for pointed intervention in the area. The government and its social partners, as well as parents, must work harder to develop a culture of responsible behaviour among these young people. Failure to do so is not only life threatening, it perpetuates a never-ending cycle of poverty and hardship. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
