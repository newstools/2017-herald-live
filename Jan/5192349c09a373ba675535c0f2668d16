AKA has teamed up with Anatii for another single Feud. What feud? Rappers AKA and Anatii have long since buried their beef and to prove it they have just released a new collaboration together. But is it any good? And should you really spend your hard-earned cash on getting yourself a copy? Here are three reasons why we think getting your hands on the track may be the best decision you make this week: The internet is losing its minds over the track. We know that your mom told you never follow the crowd . But judging by the social media reaction to the track we think it s safe to assume that the crowd may be on to something. Since the track dropped yesterday, Twitter has been ablaze with comments and memes praising the track and encouraging people to give it a listen. It is said that break-ups (and make-ups) make the best inspiration for music. And the pair have certainly had their fair share of drama over the past two years. The pair famously fell out in 2015 after the release of AKA s hit, Composure with Anatii s management claiming that they would take legal action against AKA for using Anatii s beat on the track without permission. But the pair have got over their differences and have spent the last few months telling the world that they are working together. Of course the pair have a track record when it comes to making hits. They teamed up in 2015 on the track The Saga and saw the track race up the South African hip-hop charts. It was one of the stand-out tracks of the year and was even performed live by Anatii at the annual SA Hip-Hop Awards. Ever since the pair announced late last year that they were working together again fans have been salivating at the thought of another hit like The Saga. Little did they know that they would soon get a track that has all the potential to be even greater. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
