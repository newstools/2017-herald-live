THE RULES: Ward committee administrator Phumelelo Mtati addresses Ward 4 residents inWalmer township Picture: BRIAN WITBOOI From one s debt score to political prominence, Walmer Township residents were given the lowdown last night on what qualifies a ward committee nominee. Human settlements portfolio head Nqaba Bhanga told more than 90 residents at the Fountain Road Advice Centre, in Walmer township, that if they were seen as prominent members of their political parties they would not qualify. We do not want people who will act as deputy councillors, he said. Ward committees must respect and acknowledge the role of the councillor. Ward committees are only there to offer advice to councillors. People who stand out as political leaders in the community cannot be nominated, he said. Bhanga said residents who had failed to pay rates and retail accounts also did not qualified. If you are deemed insolvent by the credit bureau because you failed to pay some accounts, you will not be precluded. Residents were concerned that the policy on criminal records and debt meant that half of the people in the area did not qualify. Moki Cekisani, of Walmer, called the criminal records policy unfair. How is it possible that a person will be overlooked because of a petty crime committed 10 years ago, while politicians are in line for high-paying jobs? If you go to the township there is not a person who is not in debt, because we don t have jobs, Cekisani said. Resident Simphiwe Litye suggested that the policy guideline be amended to accommodate them. We hope we will be afforded the opportunity to look at the policy guidelines and see what could be changed, because many of us are unhappy with some of the guidelines, he said.
