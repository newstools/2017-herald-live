Ntsika, 17, of Zwide, is one of 41 high school pupils who graduated from the academy during a celebratory ceremony on Saturday evening. The programme, which runs over eight months, teaches Grade 11 pupils the necessary leadership skills to tackle matric, university and the working world. The free course allows youngsters from the city s northern areas to undergo extensive training in leadership, education, human rights, entrepreneurship and fighting gangsterism, violence and drug abuse.
