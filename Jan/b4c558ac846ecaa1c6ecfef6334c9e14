Mvenya and Whitfield tipped as favourites to replace Athol Trollip Who will replace Athol Trollip as leader of the DA in the Eastern Cape? Lobbying is in full swing as party members prepare for what is expected to be a highly contested provincial elective congress in less than two months. Of the names bandied about for the top job, DA provincial chairwoman Veliswa Mvenya and Nelson Mandela Bay mayoral committee member Andrew Whitfield are said to be the firm favourites to take over from Trollip. However, insiders claim that in the interest of mending divisions within the party, and as a compromise of sorts, Whitfield could run for the provincial chairmanship instead. Ten insiders from various constituencies across the province spoke on condition of anonymity as the nominations process will only formally open next month. The leadership position is key as the person chosen to lead the official opposition in the province will have the momentous task of expanding the membership and voter base of the DA, particularly that of the elusive black vote. The DA hopes to rule the Eastern Cape as well as the country in 2019. It is understood that many within the party feel that to attract black voters and shed its image as a predominantly white party, the DA must elect a black leader at the March 10 and 11 congress to be held in East London. Others, however, feel that Whitfield a former MP who ran Trollip s successful campaign to take over the Bay municipality is a good administrator and is respected in the Bay where the majority of DA voters in the province reside.
