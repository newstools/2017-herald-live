Angry parents from Kuyga outside Port Elizabeth toyi-toyed and burnt tyres in Cape Road yesterday to voice their frustration after hundreds of schoolchildren were left stranded when their school transport arrangement was halted. The pupils are from four schools Colleen Glen, Island Reserve, Yellow Woods and Van Stadens. Parents who stay in Kuyga say education authorities want the children to attend their nearest school but the Kuyga school is full and the children had already been enrolled in their various farm schools. More than 200 pupils who reside in Kuyga but attend farm schools in the surrounding area have not been in class since school reopened. Parent and Colleen Glen Primary SGB member Andile Velem pleaded with the department to allow the children to return to classes while a solution was sought. Parent Nokrismes Dyumana said the majority of pupils had continued at Colleen Glen Primary and other farm schools when their parents were relocated to Kuyga. All along, we depended on this scholar transport until they suddenly decided to stop it on Wednesday. The department is arguing our children must attend the nearest school. However, Kuyga Primary ends with Grade 7. On top of that, they [pupils] have already been enrolled in this school and Kuyga is full, Dyumana said. Education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said a meeting between his department and parents was scheduled for tomorrow. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
