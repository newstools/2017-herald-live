The rand was marginally weaker on Monday morning continuing the volatility it experienced last week. The instability was triggered by rumours that President Jacob Zuma was planning a Cabinet reshuffle after his state of the nation address on February 9. Sunday Times reported that Brian Molefe could be in line to be named finance minister. Rand Merchant Bank s chief currency strategist John Cairns said that the rand s reaction to the speculation of a Cabinet reshuffle highlighted the extent of market concern about local politics. However he said that despite local politics the dollar was still driving the rand. The move by US President Donald Trump on Friday to sign an order shutting the borders to refugees and others from seven largely Muslim countries has indicated that Trump will act on the rhetoric he delivered during his campaign.

Combined with Friday s slightly weaker than expected US GDP print the net effect should be rand positive with dollar weakness outweighing some of the minor risk-off [sentiment] said Cairns.
