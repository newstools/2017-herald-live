Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa board chairman Popo Molefe has confirmed that company secretary Lindikhaye Zide has been appointed as acting CEO to replace ousted Collins Letsoalo. Meanwhile Cromet Molepo was appointed as acting CEO of Prasa Rail. That&#8217;s not breaking news man Molefe told TMG Digital on Wednesday. When we told that guy (Collins Letsoalo) to go we immediately appointed those acting CEO&#8217;s on the same day said Molefe. Letsoalo was axed after a Sunday Times report detailing how he as acting Group CEO demanded a 350% salary increase and a chauffeur. During an interview with Xolani Gwala on Radio 702 on Wednesday Letsoalo denied that the Prasa board had the power to fire him despite his signature on a contract with a clause saying they could do just that. Letsoalo did not report to Prasa offices for work on Wednesday. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
