Within hours of a warning issued by unions about dangerous conditions at Livingstone Hospital&#8217;s Accident and Emergency Unit, a patient hanged himself in the busy part of the hospital early on Sunday morning (05/03/17). Eastern Cape Health Department spokesman Sizwe Kupelo confirmed the incident, saying the patient was a known schizophrenic who defaulted on his treatment. He said an emergency strategy, immediately employing eight psychiatric nurses to the unit, will be implemented today. The incident comes less than two days after hospital labour unions warned that Livingstone Hospital s accident and emergency unit is no longer safe for patients, doctors or staff due to psychiatric patients running amok. A spokesperson for three labour unions whose members work in the unit warned on Friday that there were more than 20 psychiatric patients running around unmanaged, posing a risk to those who came into contact with them.
