A voucher and a fruit basket offered by Shoprite have left a bitter taste for two women accidentally locked in a Port Elizabeth store for more than an hour last year. Noma-India Frans, 48, and Ntombizodwa Maliti, 49, were locked in at the closed Shoprite Ziyabuya Complex in KwaDwesi on November 17 while alarms blared. Security data verified the store had been locked at 7.15pm and opened again at 8.10pm after the branch manager was advised, via the police, that there were people inside. While Frans received a letter from Shoprite offering her a R1 000 voucher, Maliti was offered a fruit basket by the store s manager. Shoprite Checkers legal adviser Rene Langenhoven wrote the letter to Frans in which the shopping voucher offer was made. We wish to resolve this matter on amicable basis and hereby offer you a Shoprite shopping voucher in the amount of R1 000 in full and final settlement on this claim. Any other legal action will be opposed, the letter said.
