Capetonians heeded calls to mobilise. They gathered outside Parliament to voice their anger at President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s decision to reshuffle his cabinet at midnight including the firing Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas. Mark Haywood spokesman for Save SA called on all South Africans to join protests around the country. The secretary general for the Social Justice Coalition Phumeza Mlungwana said: &#8220;We cannot let Zuma win Zuma must know that we are not sleeping. &#8220;We are concerned at how Zuma has treated the nation. Government is not his house to just shuffle around.&#8221; Sonke Gender Justice spokesperson Patrick Godana called the axing of Gordhan and Jonas &#8221;an attack on our democracy&#8221;. &#8220;The Guptas want to control treasury. He [Zuma] did this before and gave us a weekend special. The agenda was clear all those opposed to Zuma must be removed &#8221; he said. Actress Vinnette Ebrahim of 7de Laan fame joined the crowd to express her dissatisfaction. &#8220;It is important like bread and butter and the air we breathe to come to be here outside of Parliament. We took to the streets in the Eighties and all citizens should be here [now]. It is time for us to rise and stand together &#8221; she said. Safoudien Bester chairman of the Runners for the Freedom of Palestine organisation said the ANC had betrayed the likes of Ahmed Kathrada Joe Slovo and Walter Sisulu. He called on South Africans to stand together to stop the current ANC leaders and &#8221;this vile dictatorship&#8221; from continuing.
