BIG REVAMP: Perfect William, from Dafco, is one of the painters working at the Edward Hotel Picture: EUGENE COETZEE King Edward under new management with R10m revamp already begun The pride of Port Elizabeth s Central area is set to be restored to its former glory when the iconic King Edward Hotel reopens under the management of Eastern Cape hospitality group Lion Roars Hotels and Lodges in November. The hotel, which enjoys commanding views of the Port Elizabeth Harbour and the Donkin Reserve, has been closed since 2008 after it was bought by Dubai-based Akula Trading, which still owns the property. The relaunch of the sprawling 103-year-old hotel is expected to play a crucial role in the revival of the immediate area surrounding the facility and comes after extensive upgrades and additions were made to the Donkin Reserve. A short distance from the King Edward Hotel, the Port Elizabeth Opera House in Whites Road also recently underwent a significant upgrade and has been complemented by a number of other Mandela Bay Development Agency-driven upgrades to infrastructure, buildings and parks in recent years. All this is expected to assist in both the economic, tourism and social upliftment of the greater Central precinct. Lion Roars, which has secured a 10-year contract to manage the facility, has an extensive portfolio of offerings ranging from boutique and luxurious hotels, wine estates and lodges to game reserves and tours. They are based across the Eastern and Western Cape, with a major focus on the Garden Route. Lion Roars head Kevin Bailey said the building had been used as a private residence for a number of years.
