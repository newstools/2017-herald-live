Summer went out with a bang on Tuesday (28/02/17) with a record high temperature of 45 C recorded in Nelson Mandela Bay. Presenting what he called a mixed bag of interesting facts South African Weather Service spokesman in Port Elizabeth, Garth Samspon, said the 45 C at Coega was the highest on record, surpassing the 27 December 2012 record of 42.5 C by a full 2.5 C . This is a perfect example of, among other things, the influence of topography, wind direction, proximity to sea and positioning in the bay under berg wind conditions, Sampson said. Also of interest to Sampson was the 15 C difference between Coega and Shark Rock Pier only 19km away. The weather office had warned of uncomfortable conditions, possibly hazardous to health, on Tuesday as the mercury soared above 30 C across the Eastern Cape with Discomfort Levels of 100 and above. The last day of February marks the official end of summer which starts on December 1 in the southern hemisphere. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
