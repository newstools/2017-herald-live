The announcement of the new Bafana Bafana coach will be made only next week according to the South African Football Association. Safa tweeted on the official Bafana Bafana Twitter page yesterday that the new coach was not available for a press conference this week when the announcement was expected to have been made. Former Bafana and Portugal, and current Iran coach Carlos Queiroz has been hotly tipped for a return with TMG Digital reporting former Zambia Ivory Coast and Morocco coach Herve Renard as strong opposition. Former Orlando Pirates and Egypt coach Ruud Krol, Hugo Broos who won the Africa Cup of Nations with Cameroon in February and Bidvest Wits coach Gavin Hunt have also been named as being on a Safa short-list in reports. The new coach will replace Ephraim Shakes Mashaba who was sacked following a disciplinary hearing in December. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
