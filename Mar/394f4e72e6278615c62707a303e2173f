Baleka Mbete File picture: Kevin Sutherland None of the service providers for The Speaker s Ball a post-Sona event hosted by National Assembly Speaker Baleka Mbete has been paid in full, according to the DA. Some had not received any payment for the event held at a five-star Camps Bay hotel last month, DA chief whip John Steenhuisen alleged yesterday. He said the DA would be reporting the matter to parliament s Joint Committee on Ethics and Members Interests as it contended that Mbete had brought the Office of the Speaker into disrepute. More than a month after the event several small businesses are still owed payments ranging from R70 453 for flowers and decor, to R206 482 for catering and staffing Steenhuisen said. It was understood that service providers in the Western Cape had been engaged by a Johannesburg events company which in turn had been engaged by yet another Johannesburg events company purporting to be acting on behalf of Mbete and Nkuli Kgositsile both of whom were personally involved in planning the event. We are led to believe that legal action is now pending against Mbete he said. TMG Digital Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
