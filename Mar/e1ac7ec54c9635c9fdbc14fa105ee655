Andile Lungisa Picture: Vathiswa Ruselo / Gallo Images / Sowetan ANC regional chairman has until day s end to resign or face action in party constitution dispute Nelson Mandela Bay ANC regional chairman Andile Lungisa has until the end of today to resign or face disciplinary action. However, he is digging in his heels and refusing to acknowledge the ultimatum from the ANC s Eastern Cape bosses, saying the matter is being handled by national party leaders. ANC provincial secretary Oscar Mabuyane sent a letter to Lungisa on Monday instructing him to step down as regional chairman in line with the decision taken last week by the party s top six Jacob Zuma, Cyril Ramaphosa, Baleka Mbete, Gwede Mantashe, Jessie Duarte and Zweli Mkhize. The letter, which has been seen by The Herald, states: The ANC PEC [provincial executive committee] have considered the matter relating to your elections as the ANC chairperson of [the] Nelson Mandela [Bay] region and the subsequent correspondence from the ANC NEC [national executive committee] officials. The PEC officials in their consideration concurred with NEC officials and you are therefore advised to resign from [the] position of chairperson. This decision must be effected latest by Thursday 23 March 2017. Failure to heed this advice may lead to disciplinary action being considered against you. This follows weeks of letters between Lungisa and secretary-general Mantashe, who is adamant that party leaders who serve on other higher structures of the party are barred by the ANC s constitution from serving on lower structures. Lungisa has not yet resigned as a member of the PEC. For the full story read The Herald, or get the complete newspaper, including comics, classifieds, crosswords and back editions in our e-Edition.
