Brent Cunningham (L) leaves court with William Smith Picture: Kathryn Kimberley Serial offender Brent Cunningham is once again a free man, after the prosecution withdrew the theft charges against him on Thursday (09/03/17). Cunningham, 25, was accused of stealing his mother, Sonja&#8217;s car and laptop. The withdrawal comes after out of court negotiations between the state and the defence. Cunningham was just 18 when he first grabbed headlines in 2009 for stabbing Juan Matthews, 19, to death following an altercation over a motorcycle. He was acquitted of the murder in March 2011, after a court found that he had acted in self- defence. In November 2011, he received a suspended prison sentence for assaulting his father, Malcolm, the principal of Bluewater Bay Primary School. At the time, and part of his bail conditions, he was ordered to undergo regular urine tests because of his steroid addiction, something he claimed caused him to become excessively aggressive. Then, in 2014, Cunningham was accused of assaulting ex-girlfriend Shireen Ballan and her friends, Albert Erasmus and Chantal Burger. A court once again found he had acted in self-defence and acquitted him. In 2015, he was convicted of a second assault on his father, and one on his girlfriend at the time, Sharon Roberts. He was given a suspended prison sentence and placed under house arrest after a plea and sentence agreement was reached with the state. In addition, Cunningham was ordered to complete anger management programmes. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
