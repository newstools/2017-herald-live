Emilia Clarke as Daenerys Targaryen Picture: Macall B. Polay / HBO Popular fantasy drama television series Game of Thrones makes its long-awaited return this winter &#8211; the South African winter that is. The release date for season seven was announced live &#8211; and in a rather dramatic fashion &#8211; on the official Game of Thrones Facebook page on Thursday night (09/03/17). An adaptation of George R. R. Martin&#8217;s A Song of Ice and Fire, the HBO series is about nine noble families&#8217; fight for control over the mythical lands of Westeros. Fans had to comment either FIRE or DRACARYS as a flame melted a block of ice to reveal the #GoTS7 date &#8211; July 16. And while the release coincides with the southern hemisphere winter, those in other parts of the world would have preferred better timing. Here is some of the reaction to the announcement: Watch the season seven trailer: Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
