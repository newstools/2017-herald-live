Two burglars were each sentenced to an effective 10 years behind bars for 10 burglaries in the Patensie area last year. Tholang Selomo, 26, and Letseka Moepi, 25, were sentenced in the Hankey Regional Court on Wednesday for housebreaking and theft. The two accused caused an uproar in the Patensie community last year when they were involved in burglaries at houses in the Kwagga and Gonnakop areas, police spokeswoman Gerda Swart said yesterday. Police received information which they acted upon swiftly and apprehended the two on November 3 at a home in Stuurman Road, Ramaphosa.
