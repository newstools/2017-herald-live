Part of the roof of the Charlotte Maxeke Hospital in Johannesburg has collapsed. While details are sketchy emergency services and the Gauteng Department of Health confirmed that it was a structural collapse. A fifteen-year-old girl who didn&#8217;t want her name used said she was &#8220;lost for words&#8221; as the roof collapsed just as she was about to enter the hospital. &#8220;I was late for my appointment at the dentist. I was about to go in when it happened. &#8220;In my mind I didn&#8217;t think the roof would fall. I&#8217;m lost for words &#8221; she said. &#8220;All I saw was the roof collapse and then there was a lot of dust. I could just hear people scream and then we came outside &#8221; she said. &#8220;I&#8217;m glad I wasn&#8217;t trapped inside but I still feel really bad for the people trapped inside.&#8221; Another woman who only identified herself as Nomsa said she was standing near the lift when she heard a noise saw some dust and then a louder noise. &#8220;I heard a bang and then the roof collapsed. I was on my way to the pharmacy when it happened. I&#8217;m glad I didn&#8217;t make it all the way in &#8221; she said. The Gauteng Department of Health issued a statement confirming there had been a structural collapse at the hospital. &#8220;The collapse took place in the passage near maternity department on the hospital street. At this stage we can neither confirm the number of injuries nor what caused the collapse. &#8220;Emergency Medical Services are at the scene. The Department will update the public continuously as we get more information on the incident &#8221; the department said in a statement. A video by Twitter user Werner Vermaak and posted on the social network shows the aftermath of the collapse. [VIDEO] #CharlotteMaxeke roof collapse.
