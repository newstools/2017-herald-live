More than a month after their arrest, the case involving a Bangladeshi man and a South African woman accused of orchestrating illegal marriages has yet again been postponed. Last week, Bangladeshi national Abu Bokar, 35, and South African Nomabandla Mangezi, 43, were arrested for a second time when the Hawks nabbed them as they arrived at the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court for their formal bail application in their first case. Bokar and Mangezi are accused of arranging illegal marriages between Bangladeshi men and South African women for the men to obtain South African identity documents. Yesterday, the pair s formal bail application in the first case was postponed and set down for April 6 and 7, while a bail application for the second case was postponed until April 7.
