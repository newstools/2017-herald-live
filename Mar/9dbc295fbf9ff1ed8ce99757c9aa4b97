The search continues for a one-month old baby who was in a car when it was hijacked in Durban on Friday Picture: Supplied The frantic search for missing one-month-old Siwaphiwe &#8211; who was taken in an apparent hijacking &#8211; is set to continue on Saturday morning. The little girl&#8217;s mom Sibongile Mbambo was in her car with Siwaphiwe and her 8-year-old son when two armed men approched the vehicle shortly before noon on Friday. Mbambo and her son were forced out of the white Toyota Yaris but the men fled with the baby still in the car seat. The vehicle was later found abandoned with Siwaphiwe her car seat her pram and her baby bag all missing. Officials involved in the search said one theory being investigated was that the baby was the intended target and not the vehicle. Kyle van Reenen of Marshall Security said that residents of the Mayville area where the car was dumped joined in the search efforts &#8211; they reportedly used torches and headlamps to move through bushes and even cemeteries to find the little girl. &#8220;There were about 150 people I would estimate along with members of the police Search and Rescue Unit &#8221; he said. More people were expected to join the search on Saturday morning. This is a developing story. &#8211; TMG Digital/TimesLive Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
