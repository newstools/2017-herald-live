YOUTH VIEW: NMMU development studies student and panel member Sandile Mjamba speaks at the conference Picture: MARK WEST Firms reluctance to employ young people slated by students and activists Risks associated with heavy drinking, substance abuse and irresponsible behaviour, coupled with a tough economy, have seen businesses reluctant to hire young people. This emerged yesterday as students, business leaders and social activists in Port Elizabeth discussed how to get young people the worst-affected by unemployment into jobs. The Youth Employment Enterprise Skills Solutions (YEESS) conference held at the ETC conference centre in Zwide sought to expose young people to job or entrepreneurial opportunities in the city. During a panel discussion, youth agency Harambee provincial manager Masa Mlamla said some companies were reluctant to employ young people because of perceived associated behavioural risks. Olwam Mnqwazi, 32, of the Black Hat leadership academy, said: Young people are not receiving the risk label as a comment but as an assault on their youthfulness. To look at them and start putting tags [such as] young people are irresponsible, drunkards, abuse drugs and are not educated constitutes a perpetuated assault on young people based on their being a part of the youth. This, in turn, puts the blame on the youth for not being employed. NMMU final-year development studies student Sandile Mjamba, 23, said the risk label was an outright resistance to change. The reality is that the youth are the majority and are the most affected and marginalised when it comes to unemployment, Mjamba said. Because of that, we are seeing the frustration mushrooming into chaos in the form of movements such as #FeesMustFall and #HireAGraduate.
