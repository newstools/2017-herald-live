PLAYERS REUNION: Former EP Cricket Association players Burton Forbes, front, Faghme Abrahams, back left, and Stephen Draai are looking forward to their reunion at South End Boulevard Cafe on March 10 Picture: EUGENE COETZEE Three appeals cause of title uncertainty Uncertainty continued in NMB Premier League club cricket circles this week with the three clubs in the running for the title not knowing which of them is any closer to winning it. Gelvandale have completed their league programme but are awaiting the outcome of their appeal against Buco Uitenhage regarding player eligibility. Gelvandale lost that game and if the result is reversed they may well be crowned champions. Jendamark United are waiting on the result of two appeals. One is against United Brothers, also for player eligibility, and the other is for an abandoned game against SA Home Loans Union. Mecer Madibaz 1 is the third club in the running. They have no outstanding appeals, but their final position on the log will be affected by the eventual rulings. A letter was sent to the affected clubs this week indicating that the judicial official, who is set to preside over the appeals, was only due to arrive back in the city late yesterday. Only then would clarity be reached on dates and times for the hearings, the letter said. In the meantime, clubs will play blindly this weekend as the league approaches its end. The big game of the weekend is that between Madibaz 1 and United. Both will want to keep winning going down the final stretch. A loss for either team could see them fall out of the race. The other match tomorrow will be a basement battle between EMediaIT Heatherbank and Northville. On Sunday, Madibaz 2 host SUPERSPAR Despatch and Motherwell entertain Northville. This weekend s fixtures are (home teams first, 10am starts): Heatherbank v Northville; Mecer Madibaz 1 v United Madibaz 2 v Despatch; Motherwell v Northville THE latest standings, subject to ratification by the log keeper, are: 1 Gelvandale 65 (13), 2 United 49 (9), 3 PECC 47 (12), 4 Union 42 (10), 5 Despatch 42 (12), 6 Madibaz 1 41 (9), 7 Old Grey 36 (12), 8 United Brothers 30 (11), 9 Uitenhage 30 (11), 10 Madibaz 2 21 (9), 11 Schauderville 19 (13), 12 Motherwell 18 (12), 13 Northville 8 (9), 14 Heatherbank 7 (10) Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
