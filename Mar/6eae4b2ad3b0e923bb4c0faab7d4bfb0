Two young men accused of stealing Buddy the penguin hope that the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court will withdraw the criminal charges against them. Yesterday, the case against Adrian Donian, 22, and Emile du Plessis, 18, was postponed to April 19 for their legal representatives to make representations to the National Director of Public Prosecutions . The friends allegedly snatched the African penguin from its enclosure at the Bayworld complex in September last year, before releasing him back into the ocean. Buddy was undergoing rehabilitation at Bayworld at the time. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
