MATCH ABANDONED: Mamelodi Sundowns Sibusiso Vilakazi and Chippa United s Andile Mbenyane during their Absa Premiership match at Loftus Versfeld in Pretoria last night Picture: GALLO IMAGES The lights went out minutes before half time at Loftus Versfeld with last night s Absa Premiership game at 0-0 between Mamelodi Sundowns and Chippa United, causing the match to be abandoned. The problem was apparently caused by a power failure in the Hatfield area of Pretoria. Match officials first waited for technicians to attend to the failure before taking a decision to abandon the game, which was brought to a halt in the 43rd minute. PSL communications manager Luxolo September could not specify when the match would be completed. He said, according to the PSL&#8217;s Rule 14.17, the clubs have to agree on a time, within 48 hours, to complete an abandoned game. September said last night the two clubs could not agree on a time though he could not specify why so the onus fell on the league to decide. With the match having to be resumed from the 41st minute, with both sets of players that were on the field, it seems unlikely the PSL will set a date later than 48 hours, as this could result in complications from players becoming injured. &#8220;The match had to be abandoned because of a power failure, not only in the stadium but in the precinct around it,&#8221; September said.
