Bay photographer Astrid Cordier captured the wedding day of Nicole and Haylin Redelinghuys, winners of The Herald Bride and Groom 2016 competition. Cordier, who was instrumental in getting the Uitenhage couple to enter the competition, said she Nicole and Haylin were an amazing couple and she enjoyed shooting their pictures. &#8220;They really deserve this title. They where such an awesome couple to shoot, from the gorgeous forest setting for their pre-wedding shoot to the wedding day. Always happy and smiling and so in love,&#8221; she said. The couple were married on April 30 last year with a reception at Africanos Country Estate in Addo after a wedding ceremony at St Martin de Porres Roman Catholic Church in Uitenhage.
