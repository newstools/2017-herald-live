A Port Elizabeth teenager was raped inside her home in Overbaakens yesterday during a suspected botched robbery. The 18-year-old, who cannot be named due to being a victim of rape, was attacked by three men who forced their way into the house. No weapons were used in the attack, but the three men threatened the teenager, police spokeswoman Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said. The incident happened shortly after midday while the girl was home alone. The men first attempted to enter through another door of the house, which is when the woman was alerted to the men. She attempted to press her panic button but it failed to work, she said. The men then gained entry through a sliding door. She was then forced into a bedroom where one of the men allegedly raped her, Janse van Rensburg said. It is believed the other two men ransacked the house. The girl managed to break free at some point and pressed a panic button in the bedroom, which worked, Janse van Rensburg said. When the alarm went off, the three men fled.
