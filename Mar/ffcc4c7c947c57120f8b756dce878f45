One of the photographs from around the world included in the exhibition Objectif Sport by Mohammed Reaz from Dhaka-Bangladesh The Alliance Fran aise in Southern Africa is presenting Objectif Sport an international photo exhibition on sport which is touring South Africa this year in support of the #Paris2024 Campaign. The Objectif Sport exhibition is the outcome of the 2016 international photo competition organised by the Foundation Alliance Fran aise in Paris and features 42 photographs chosen from hundreds of submissions by photographers from 103 Alliances Fran aises. The Alliance recognises that sport is a global phenomenon that touches all aspects of modern society, says a spokesman, hence firing the starting gun on this particular art project. As well as being a massive industry worth an estimated 91 billion dollars, on a personal level sport also brings people together, whether it is to support a team, to take part in a competition or to simply enjoy taking part in an outdoor activity. The exhibition images go beyond the well-known and mass appeal sports such as soccer, tennis, Formula One and tried to include unknown traditional sports such as Nepalese women wrestling, Indian bull fighting and more. Objectif Sport started its South African tour in Pretoria and will be open in Port Elizabeth at the Alliance in Mackay Street until April 21 before moving to Durban, Johannesburg and finally Cape Town.
