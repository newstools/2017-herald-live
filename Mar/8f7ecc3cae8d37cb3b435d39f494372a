Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema is going to the Constitutional Court in a bid to force the speaker of Parliament to institute impeachment or disciplinary proceedings against President Jacob Zuma. The court application just after lunch on Thursday will revolve around the conduct of Zuma associated with the Nkandla scandal and lying to Parliament on numerous occasions . The action comes almost one year to the day that the highest court in the land handed down judgement in the Nkandla saga. We approach the Constitutional Court as a last resort based on the belief that Zuma&#8217;s conduct around the Nkandla matter both inside and outside of Parliament renders him unfit to hold the high office of President of the Republic of South Africa said a statement from EFF spokesman Mbuyiseni Ndlozi. &#8211; TMG Digital Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
