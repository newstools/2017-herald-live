NMB mayor Athol Trollip Picture: Rapport / Deon Ferrreira / Gallo Images A criminal case against a former DA member who allegedly defamed Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip hit another snag yesterday, causing the matter to be postponed once again. A relative of Nontuthuzelo Jack, 47, arrived at the Port Elizabeth Regional Court yesterday where Jack was due to appear on a charge of criminal defamation to inform the prosecutor that she was still unable to attend proceedings due to a broken leg. Jack is accused of defaming Trollip by claming that he offered her a bribe to dig up dirt on DA provincial chairwoman Veliswa Mvenya. The matter was postponed to tomorrow for Jack to produce a doctor s note. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
