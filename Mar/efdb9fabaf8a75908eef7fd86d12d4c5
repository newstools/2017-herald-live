As many as three taxis were set alight on the R61 between Libode and Port St Johns in a raging taxi war among rival associations over routes, which has claimed nearly 20 lives since its outbreak last year. However, Mthatha police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Mzukisi Fatyela was only able to confirm one incident, in which a minibus taxi was set alight near Mtyu village at 2pm on Saturday. We believe it s related to ongoing taxi violence, Fatyela said. He said the other areas did not fall under his jurisdiction. Police spokesman Captain Mduduzi Godlwana said he had heard about the torched taxis and promised to follow up, but he could not be reached for comment late yesterday. However, provincial health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo confirmed that two other taxis had been burnt in Dangwana and Bhomsi villages on Saturday morning. No one was injured in the attacks, according to Kupelo. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
