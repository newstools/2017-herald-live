&nbsp; Brent Cunningham Notorious Port Elizabeth bad boy Brent Cunningham is back in court, and this time he is accused of stealing from his mother. Cunningham, 25, who has had more than his fair share of run-ins with the law and still has a suspended prison sentence hanging over his head, was arrested on Wednesday, after he allegedly stole his mother s car and laptop from their Nancy Road, Lorraine, family home. His mother, Sonja, called the police during the early hours of February 28, after her house alarm woke her up and she discovered that her laptop and Opel Corsa were missing. The front sliding door was reportedly left wide open. The bulky Cunningham first grabbed headlines as a teenager when he stabbed a friend to death following an altercation over a motorcycle. In the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court yesterday, he looked disappointed when he was told he would have to spend the weekend behind bars. Because of his previous convictions for assault two on his father and one on a former girlfriend prosecutor Tim van Rooyen said the state was opposed to him being released on bail.
