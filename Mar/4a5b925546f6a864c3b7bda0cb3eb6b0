CLEANING UP: Chief ranger Yousuf Cassim, left, and deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani speak to Sivuyile Dikana, who works for the sanitation department Picture: EUGENE COETZEE The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality plans to clamp down on the illegal dumping of waste by conducting more roadblocks and inspecting dumpsites across the city. The municipality will launch a War on Illegal Dumping campaign on March 28, led by deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani. A budget of R15-million has been allocated for the campaign. Some of the money will be used to hire and train staff. Bobani said the municipality would also launch a R3-billion recycling project soon, but did not elaborate. In a build-up to the campaign, Bobani visited the Koedoeskloof Tip in Uitenhage with the media, where he found poor working conditions at a recycling company operating at the dumpsite. The workers were not wearing protective gear like gloves and helmets. There were also a number of people scavenging for food at the dumpsite. I will be looking at the company s contract because we don t want people to work under these conditions, he said. These are our people and we want their working condition to be better.
