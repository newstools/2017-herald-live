Omsin, a 25 year old female green sea turtle, rests next to a tray of coins that were removed from her stomach Picture: Athit Perawongmetha / Reuters A sea turtle dubbed &#8216;Piggy Bank&#8217; has had her fortunes restored after Thai vets removed 915 coins from her stomach a deposit built up after years of gulping down good luck pennies tossed into its pond. The 25-year-old turtle, called &#8216;Omsin&#8217; in Thai, underwent a gruelling seven-hour surgery on Monday to remove the 5kg hoard of coins. She was sent to Bangkok vets with a cracked shell and an X-ray unexpectedly revealed the haul, which came in various currencies. &#8220;There were 915 coins in her stomach, we removed them one by one,&#8221; said Nantrika Chansue, a veterinarian in charge of Chulalongkorn hospital&#8217;s aquatic research centre told AFP. &#8220;Piggy Bank is okay now but she will have to remain at the centre for up to two weeks,&#8221; the vet added, saying it was the first surgery of its kind. The troubled reptile lived for two decades in a small public park in Chonburi Province. Visitors tossed coins into her pond seeking to &#8216;make merit&#8217; or good luck, a practice vets have urged the public to stop. &#8220;A turtle can live up to 80 years and the belief is that throwing coins into the turtle pond will make the coin thrower live longer,&#8221; Rungroj Thanawongnuvej, Dean of the Faculty of Veterinary Science at Chulalongkorn said in a statement. &#8220;Throwing the coins is more bad karma because it is animal torture.&#8221; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
