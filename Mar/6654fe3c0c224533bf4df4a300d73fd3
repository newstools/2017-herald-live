ANC MP Vytjie Mentor File picture: Trevor Samson Gupta family-owned Oakbay Investments has hit out at former ANC MP Vytjie Mentor who posted on Facebook over the weekend that the current social grants crisis was designed to allow a Gupta-owned company to be given the contract at the 11th hour. We are very familiar with the statements of fantasy that tend to be made by Mentor Oakbay said. Her latest suggestion is preposterous and would be laughable if it wasn t taken so seriously by some. Unfortunately if a dog barked something negative about the Gupta family some media houses would print it the statement read. Both of these stories are just more evidence of a campaign by some against Oakbay and the Gupta family based as usual on nothing more than innuendo. Mentor told TimesLIVE on Tuesday morning (07/03/17) she was looking forward to meeting the Gupta family in court after their lawyer Gert van der Merwe said that he had advised the family to take legal action against her. All I can tell you is that I really want to meet them in court period Mentor said. &#8211; TMG Digital Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
