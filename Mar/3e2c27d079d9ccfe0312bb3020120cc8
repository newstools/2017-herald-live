The book fair promotes books, writers, libraries, reading and writing activities in the Bay. The project also supports previously unheard and unpublished voices from the metro by showcasing their work in exhibition events during the fair, linking the most talented of these writers with South African book agents and publishers. The fair has a long-standing relationship with the Rhodes University Masters programme in creative writing and very often hosts the programme s information-sharing meetings with and for prospective writing students from the metro and the province. The MBBF has become t he ideal place for writers in the metro to establish contacts with publishers, book funders, national artists, book illustrators, prominent writers and business agents. It is open from 9am to 6pm each day and attendance is free. Further information from Mxolisi Nyezwa, 078-643-4472, 072-424-6896, e-mail: imbizo.arts@gmail.com.
