Springsteen is widely known for his brand of poetic lyrics, Americana, his working class and sometimes political sentiments centered on his native New Jersey, and his distinctive voice. His most successful studio albums, Born to Run (1975) and Born in the USA (1984), showcase a talent for finding grandeur in the struggles of daily American life. He has sold more 120-million records worldwide and more than 64-million records in the United States, making him one of the world s best-selling artists of all time. Centrestage s Gary Hemmings, a long-time Springsteen fan, says Kallis is a vocal dead ringer for Springsteen and the band would include a terrific horn section .
