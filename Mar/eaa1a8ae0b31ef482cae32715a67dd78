Nkosinathi Msimango moments before handing himself over to police at the Boschkop Police station, East of Pretoria Picture: Alaister Russell/TheTimes The man arrested in connection with the theft of computers at the Chief Justice&#8217;s office was taken out of prison interrogated and &#8220;slapped around &#8221; the Randburg Magistrate&#8217;s Court has heard. Nkosinathi Msimango appeared in court on Monday facing charges of housebreaking with intent to steal and theft. His counsel Advocate Marchand Killian told the court Msimango was taken out of prison at 9pm on Friday and brought back at 1am. &#8220;My client handed himself over. Despite that he was chained. &#8220;That is unacceptable. His rights are infringed. He was taken out of prison to Nasrec. He was slapped around and interrogated &#8221; Killian said. The state asked that the case be postponed to verify Msimango&#8217;s address the value of the items that were stolen and to check whether he has previous convictions. Kllian however opposed the postponement of his client&#8217;s bail application. &#8220;I have to object to a further postponement on the basis of verifying an address.&#8221; He said the state does not have any evidence against Msimango and that they wanted to keep Msimango in prison while they investigate his case. &#8220;My client handed himself over to the police. Once you arrest you must make sure you have sufficient evidence.&#8221; The court postponed the case until Friday for a formal bail application. Msimango is said by police to be the man &#8220;crucial&#8221; to the investigation into the burglary at the Chief Justice&#8217;s office two weeks ago. Fifteen computers were stolen. Last week The Times had an exclusive interview with Msimango just moments before he handed himself over. He told the newspaper that he does not know anything about the burglary and did not understand why he was wanted. &#8211; TMG Digital Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
