South African Emlyn Culverwell and his Ukrainian fianc e, Iryna Nohai, were arrested at the end of January for a Zina moral offence in Abu Dhabi Picture: Facebook A motion was presented to parliament yesterday condemning the incarceration of Emlyn Culverwell and his fianc e who are being held in a United Arab Emirates prison for pregnancy out of wedlock. The motion was presented by Democratic Alliance MP and deputy shadow environmental minister Terry Stander. Emlyn s mom Linda Culverwell and family have been fighting for the release of the couple for the last six weeks. Due to the exposure that the story has generated nationwide a Durban woman made contact with Linda and revealed that her daughter is in a similar situation and currently locked up with Iryna Nohai in the prison cell. Through this call Linda was able to learn that Nohai was still pregnant. According to Linda she has received an overwhelming amount of support through the public. I never dreamed so many people would care. I have been on the phone non-stop. I m tired but it s a good tired Linda said. Linda was also offered a plane ticket by an employee at Yas Waterworld to Abu Dhabi so that she could visit Emlyn and hopefully Nohai. Only family members who share the same family name are allowed to visit detainees. Linda also learned that neither Emlyn or Nohai have had any word with each other and attempts to send money for phone calls have been futile. -TMG/Talk of the Town Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
