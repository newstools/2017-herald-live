Treasury staff burst into song as Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy arrived for their final meeting after the Cabinet reshuffle. President Jacob Zuma effected his latest reshuffle late on Thursday night; a merry-go-round that saw no less than 10 changes to his ministers alone. Gordhan was replaced by Malusi Gigaba formerly the Minister of Home Affairs. Jonas is being replaced by Sfiso Buthelezi who joined Parliament in March 2016. The JSE s banks had R86bn of their market capitalisation wiped out on Friday morning as the market reacted to the news. The move has been lambasted by opposition parties and civil society organisations, while even Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and ANC Secretary General Gwede Mantashe have weighed in. Ramaphosa called the move &#8216;unacceptable&#8217; while Mantashe said the ANC was not happy about the changes. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
