Marius Fransman Picture: Trevor Samson Suspended ANC Western Cape leader Marius Fransman is ready to go sell ice-cream but only if the party s secretary general Gwede Mantashe will stop the organisation from sinking. A row between the two erupted on Thursday after Fransman publicly attacked Mantshe on his handling of Andile Lungisa s election as chairman of the Nelson Mandela Bay ANC region. Mantashe accused Lungisa of flouting the party s constitution when he stood for election on a lower structure while still a member of the provincial executive committee &#8211; and subsequently won the vote. In a statement on Thursday Fransman said &#8220;I call on comrade Andile not to despair. I call on you young man not to blame the organisation but to realise that individuals being entrusted with critical responsibility can indeed fail the values and esteem of the very offices they hold&#8221;. But Mantashe hit during an interview with eNCA the same night saying &#8220;Anybody who is trying to make everybody happy in a populist way should not be a leader that person must sell ice-cream&#8221;. Fransman responded on Friday morning saying he would take up the challenge. He said he would start an initiative to help reduce poverty and unemployment by identifying 50 people for a skills development program. &#8220;[I will] make them some of the best ice-cream sellers in SA. I therefore challenge you comrade Mantashe to stop bullying activists on the ground.&#8221; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
