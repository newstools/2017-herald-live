DRAINING RESOURCES: Douglas Mbopa High caretaker Buchule Mtsila shows the ablution block that leaks due to deteriorating infrastructure Pictures: SIYAMTANDA CAPA Principals of top users blame vandalism, old infrastructure Leaks as a result of deteriorating infrastructure and vandalism have landed 25 schools on the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality s list of water wasters. Principals have attributed the wastage to leaks due to vandalism and poor maintenance, while some have blamed both the municipality and the Department of Education s inability to assist timeously. The schools were identified two weeks ago after a visit by municipal officials to Churchill Dam. The metro had announced that water wasters would have their supply cut, but head of infrastructure and engineering Annette Lovemore said this was an impossible measure to apply as schools required a constant water supply. A visit to at least 10 schools last week revealed that along with pupils leaving taps running, schools are also faced with taps that do not work, stolen water pipes and old plumbing systems. Grey High is listed as the school which uses the most water, with each of its 880 pupils consuming an average 367l daily.
