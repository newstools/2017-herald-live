&#8216;Cult Sister&#8217; retails for R225 Exclusive Books is hosting the launch of Cult Sister by Port Elizabeth reflexologist and meridian therapist Lesley Smailes next week in Walmer. Smailes spent 10 years in a sect in the US not long after leaving school and this book is her story. She recounts how her lifestyle in a controversial religious group led to her living out of a backpack, having home births, living the freeman lifestyle, entering into an arranged marriage with a Brother , receiving harsh threats of losing her children and surviving in strange and glorious ways. Cult Sister is told largely through a series of letters between Smailes and her mother. These letters, which paint an idyllic picture, stand in stark contrast to the unpleasant realities also portrayed in the book. Guests at the book launch will get a chance to hear directly from the author about the life she led in Cult Sister. The launch is at 6 for 6.30pm on April 4. Published by Tafelberg, Cult Sister retails for R225. Inquiries: walmerpark@exclusivebooks.co.za, (041) 368-4000. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
