SET TO SERVE: The Bay s metro police officers at their induction yesterday at the traffic training college in Greenbushes Picture: FREDLIN ADRIAAN The 111 Nelson Mandela Bay metro police officers inducted in Greenbushes yesterday will be stationed at two precincts in Bethelsdorp and Uitenhage. Although they will have the power to make arrests, they will not be sent to the gang-ridden northern areas until they are fully trained for high-crime areas, according to safety and security political head John Best. Speaking at the induction ceremony at the traffic college, Best said they would, for now, provide backup to the SA Police Service for gang-related crimes. Their main focus would be on traffic and bylaw enforcement, and crime prevention. Many people have asked me this question when are we going to send the metro police to the northern areas? Best said. We are going there, but I am not going to send people who are not properly trained into those areas. We will provide police with backup at the moment. Once we are comfortable to send them to high-crime areas alone, they will go. The introduction of a metro police service has been in the pipeline for about eight years. Those inducted yesterday included the 45 who qualified late last year.
