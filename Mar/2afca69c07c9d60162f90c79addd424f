More arrests may follow after company uncovers scam possibly involving a syndicate A scam involving the theft of merchandise intended for delivery to other businesses has led to the arrest of three people believed to be part of a syndicate. This was uncovered on Monday after Coastal Multi Glass discovered following an internal investigation that an employee was signing for deliveries and then allegedly stealing some of the stock. It is also suspected that the group may be in cahoots with delivery drivers, who allegedly conned other Port Elizabeth glass and aluminium companies. More arrests are expected. The three arrests followed a police raid on houses in Kensington, Malabar and Bethelsdorp on Monday, which led to the discovery of glass and aluminium fittings worth about R200 000. Cheslyn Saminathan, 39, who runs a small glass fitting and aluminium supply business, was arrested on Tuesday together with Coastal Multi Glass employee Theodore Schmidt, 41, who is charged with stealing the stock from the business. Both handed themselves over to police and appeared in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court yesterday. They were released on R5 000 bail each. During the raids, Saminathan s wife, Kruslyn, 37, was also arrested for allegedly being in possession of stolen property stashed at her Malabar home. Kruslyn appeared in the Gelvandale Magistrate s Court the same day and was released on R500 bail. Coastal Multi Glass owner Mike Levin said he believed the syndicate had been operating for about two years and had allegedly stolen between R300 000 and R400 000 worth of aluminium and glass fittings stock from him alone.
