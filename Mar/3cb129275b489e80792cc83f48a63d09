Metro starts declaration process as department threatens to close valves As Nelson Mandela Bay s water situation heads toward crisis levels with dams reaching the dreaded 45% mark the municipality has started the process to have the city declared a water disaster area. It has also emerged that the metro is operating with only half of the required maintenance workers needed to address thousands of leaks. Adding to an already dire situation, the metro has again been rapped over the knuckles by the Department of Water and Sanitation for not drastically reducing water usage in the Bay. The department, which has again threatened to close the valves and implement forced water shedding, is demanding that the municipality explain why it has not cut the city s water usage by 15% as instructed. This was revealed at a portfolio committee meeting on Friday by the metro s infrastructure, engineering and energy political head, Annette Lovemore. She said Water and Sanitation Minister Nomvula Mokonyane s department felt there had been insufficient effort on the municipality s side to curb water wastage or leaks. A report tabled at the same meeting, revealed that although there had been a slight improvement, the metro s efforts to reduce leaks were not yielding the desired results. It only managed to reduce leaks by 1.2% between December and January.
