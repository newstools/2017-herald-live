It is unfortunate that a comment was made by Luyolo Nqakula in respect of the Andile Lungisa issue, claiming to be the convener of the RTT of the ANC Youth League ( Lungisa seeks support of top brass , March 24). As a legitimate youth league branch in Ward 28 we reject and disown his statement under the name of the youth league. The provincial executive committee (PEC) of the ANC in the Eastern Cape made it very clear to all that any structure elected by the provincial task team of the youth league must not be recognised because the disbanded PEC of the youth league awaits its appeal to the league s national executive committee (NEC). The so-called RTT led by Nqakula did not even take part in the regional conference due to its illegitimacy and only the regional executive committee (REC) led by X Mgotheni participated. Therefore it cannot be correct for him to hijack the name of the ANCYL. He was speaking in his own capacity as a member, not as a structure. &#8211;Zolani Mdolomba, ANC Youth League branch secretary, Ward 28 Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
