Mosiuoa Lekota Picture: Supplied COPE s Nelson Mandela Bay regional branch has joined the call to oust party leader Mosiuoa Lekota and his executive. This follows growing calls from members, lately the Eastern Cape structures, who labelled the party leadership liars who have failed to grow the organisation . The motion of no confidence against the Congress Executive Committee (CEC) of the party was first put by COPE s Limpopo chairman, Patrick Sikhutshi, last month during a national committee meeting. COPE deputy-head MP Willie Madisha said yesterday all structures calling for heads were disrupting the party and could be suspended. Terror [Lekota] is the president, elected at a congress, he said. People who elected him are delegates sent by members of the organisation. They cannot simply rise and say he must step down. We cannot make such calls as individuals. But Bay regional spokesman Thembelani Kondile slammed Madisha as a liar who must deal with his own problems before accusing us of disrupting the party . He has no right to speak on behalf of us, Kondile said. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
