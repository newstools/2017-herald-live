Municipal contractors, working around the clock, made quick work of repairing a main water pipe which burst on Sunday night, cutting of the water supply to nearly half of Uitenhage. Contractors were sent to repair the leak in Barend Street soon after the pipe, supplying water to the Van Riebeekhoogte reservoir, burst at about 8pm on Sunday. Residents in the affected areas were without water for most of yesterday, and Uitenhage councillor Pieter Terblanche warned residents that their taps could remain dry for the rest of today. However, municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki sent out an urgent notice at about 8pm yesterday, saying the repairs were complete and residents could expect to have running water again when they woke up in the morning. The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality water services technicians have finished repair work on the Uitenhage water main line. The water has been reopened and the supply will be restored around midnight. Once again, we would like to apologise for any inconvenience caused by this burst and repair work, he said. Terblanche said they had monitored the situation and stayed in contact with the team doing the repairs. We expected the water to be off for another day, but yesterday afternoon the team told us they were making good progress, he said. A team of contractors spent most of yesterday knee deep in mud, digging around the burst pipe with picks and shovels. An excavator helped remove water and mud, while another team cut a new section of pipe to replace the broken piece. Affected areas included Van Riebeekhoogte, Scheepershoogte, Valleisig, Strelitzia Park, Winterhoek Park, Fairbridge Heights, Mosel, Penford, Levyvale and College Hill. Water tankers were sent to those areas for homes that needed clean water. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
