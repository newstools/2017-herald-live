Elza van Lingen is the new Kouga mayor Picture: Eugene Coetzee Eastern Cape Human Settlements MEC Helen Sauls-August was lambasted by Kouga mayor Elza van Lingen for delaying housing delivery in the region. After promises to Kouga communities last year that houses would be built in the Jeffreys Bay area, the MEC is yet to honour her commitment. Van Lingen said there was no movement on housing projects and it was not clear when residents would get houses. In July, the MEC was in Jeffreys Bay to introduce a contractor for the 220 Pellsrus houses, Van Lingen said. It is now eight months later and the appointment of the contractor has not been finalised. The company that was awarded the contract for Ocean View 1500 has been withdrawn. Human Settlements spokesman Lwandile Sicwetsha confirmed that the contractor who had been appointed for the Ocean View project had withdrawn his bid. The contractor introduced to the community was from Chris Hani region and was already doing other projects for the department, Sicwetsha said. But the price he asked was above our budget. He said the department was finalising tender processes for the Ocean View project, while a contractor was expected on site next month at Pellsrus.
