Provincial health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo Picture: DispatchLIVE Security measures including CCTV cameras, guards, burglar bars and security gates with access control must be fitted to the new acute psychiatric ward at Port Elizabeth s Provincial Hospital before patients can be moved there. The ward would also have isolation rooms, provincial health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said yesterday. We could not open another ward at Livingstone Hospital because we do not have space, he said. Kupelo said the plan had always been to establish a 72-hour observation facility at Provincial Hospital. Thereafter patients would be referred to the Elizabeth Donkin or Dora Nginza psychiatric hospitals. Hospital management has come under pressure from labour unions who publicly claimed that the casualty unit at Livingstone was no longer safe because of the mismanagement of mental patients. On Sunday, a patient diagnosed with schizophrenia hanged himself in the casualty unit. Kupelo said as soon as patients were identified as being in need of psychiatric care, they would be transported to Provincial Hospital by ambulance. Livingstone Hospital would remain the first point of call for all emergencies, including mental illness. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
