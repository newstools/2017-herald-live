Nontuthuzelo Jack is accused of defaming Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip Picture: Supplied With her leg in a cast, the woman accused of defaming Nelson Mandela Bay mayor Athol Trollip hobbled to the front of the court yesterday, making her first appearance since the matter was transferred to the Port Elizabeth Regional Court. Struggling to balance off her crutches, former DA member Nontuthuzelo Jack listened intently as her case was once again postponed, this time to give her an opportunity to consult her Legal Aid attorney, before a trial date is arranged. Yesterday was the first time Jack appeared in the regional court, after missing two previous appearances due to a broken bone in her lower leg. A warrant was issued for her arrest, but was held over until yesterday. Jack is accused of defaming Trollip by claiming that he had offered her a bribe to dig up dirt on DA provincial chairwoman Veliswa Mvenya. At the time, Jack and Trollip aspired to hold the same position in the DA. Her claims were published in The Herald s sister newspaper, the Daily Dispatch, between March and April last year in the run-up to the municipal elections. She now faces the relatively rare charge of criminal defamation. The case was postponed to April 5. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
