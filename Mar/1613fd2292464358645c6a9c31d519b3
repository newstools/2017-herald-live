President Jacob Zuma has ordered Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas to return from an investor roadshow in the UK and US saying the trip was unauthorised . Treasury officials confirmed to Business Day that preparations were being made for the possible cancellation of the US leg of the tour. Gordhan s future as finance minister has been in question since he replaced Des van Rooyen in December 2015 and the threat of arrest has persistently hung over him. In October 2016 the National Prosecuting Authority said it was investigating Gordhan for fraud but later dropped those charges. Earlier in 2016 he was investigated by the Hawks over allegations of a rogue unit at SARS and there was talk of his imminent arrest. President Zuma was reported to have said early last month that Treasury was standing in the way of transformation. Gordhan has been instrumental in South Africa s efforts to stave off rating downgrades by international credit agencies. The country has spent the past year-and-a-half on the brink of a downgrade to junk status and a review by Moody s is due on Friday next week. More to follow.
