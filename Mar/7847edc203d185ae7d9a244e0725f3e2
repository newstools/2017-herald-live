Loyiso Bala will sing in the Bay over Easter Award-winning South African singer Loyiso Bala will be performing in Port Elizabeth on Easter weekend at the Word of Faith Christian Centre in Walmer Downs. Known for his smooth R&amp;B voice, Bala has performed across the globe alongside the likes of John Legend, Jamelia, Elton John and Will Smith. He will perform from 7pm on Friday April 14. I have been looking forward to coming back to Word of Faith for a couple of years now since my last visit. To gather my hometown in one place, so as to worship our God is the greatest privilege I could ever ask for, Bala said. I love to sing, not only to entertain, but to make an eternal difference in people s lives, and gospel music has afforded me this opportunity. In 2012, Loyiso recorded his live Christian music DVD Love Complete. He went on to release the chart-topping single Time to Dance, which garnered huge success and became the precursor to his second Christian music album, Power Love Sound. Having won five South African Music Awards (Samas) and three Metro FM awards, two of which were for the best R&amp;B album and best producer, Bala was also nominated at the MTV Awards alongside international stars Alicia Keys, Rihanna and Akon. In addition, he was a popular choice for voters in You Magazine s sexiest man, GQ magazine s most stylish man and Men s Health magazine s best man. Having graduated top of his class at the Drakensberg Boys Choir, Loyiso became the youngest conductor of the National Youth Choir at 19 and has since become a household name in South Africa, with his very first album selling triple platinum. Tickets are R80 for adults and R30 for teens, with children under 10 free. Inquiries: Word of Faith, (041) 399-4400 or e-mail info@wordoffaith.org.za.
