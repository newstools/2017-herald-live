Is it you? A person who bought a lottery ticket for R15 has become rich beyond all dreams &#8211; but has not yet come forward to claim the winnings. The Lotto Plus jackpot of R26.5 million was won last night 1 March 2017 by a punter who made a manual bet of R15 and selected his or her&#8217;s own six numbers. This is the 7th jackpot winner from the Free State says operator Ithuba. The winning ticket was purchased at RM Bottle Store in Hennenman Free State. The town east of Welkom has a population of just 3 793 people living in 1 281 households according to Stats SA. A second winner from the Free State has also not yet come forward to claim the PowerBall winning ticket of R9.4 million. The draw for this ticket was 24 February 2017. This winning ticket was a Quick Pick ticket bought at the Post Office in Ficksburg according to Ithuba. All winners have 365 days to claim before their tickets expire. The operator congratulated its Free State winners &#8220;and encourages all players to spend their winnings wisely ensuring they make use of all the winner&#8217;s services available&#8221;. &#8220;Once a winner has come forward to claim their winnings they receive financial advice and planning from Ithuba as well as emotional counselling which aims to assist the winners with their new financial statuses.&#8221; Prizes up to R2 000 can be claimed at any retailer whereas winnings between R2 000 and R50 000 need to be redeemed at the Post Office. Prizes valued at more than R50 000 must be claimed at one of the Ithuba regional offices. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
