The Nelson Mandela Bay municipality is getting rid of 45 municipal vehicles which are more than 20 years old. The vehicles, assessed by mechanics, have been deemed uneconomical to repair or maintain and are thus not suitable for use. The details of the vehicles are contained in a report to the corporate services portfolio committee, which met yesterday. Among the oldest of the 45 vehicles are a tar distributor, which is 51 years old, a pulvi mixer and a compressor, which have been in use for 44 years. The municipality has also replaced seven vehicles in use for less than 10 years which have been badly damaged in accidents.
