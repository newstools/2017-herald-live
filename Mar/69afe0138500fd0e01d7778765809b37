ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe is unhappy with President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s Cabinet reshuffle saying the party&#8217;s top leaders gave no input to the list of replacement Cabinet members. &#8220;We were informed not consulted that&#8217;s how I can describe it &#8221; Mantashe told 702 Radio on Friday. &#8220;The list was given to us complete. The list might have been developed somewhere for us (the ANC top six) to legitimise.&#8221; The presidency officially announced a reworked Cabinet after midnight following months of speculation. Speaking to Xolani Gwala Mantashe was clearly unhappy with Zuma&#8217;s decision to reshuffle his Cabinet and in particular the decision to remove Pravin Gordhan as finance minister. Malusi Gigaba will replace Gordhan. &#8220;I can&#8217;t be happy with that. The finance minister was a hard worker. I&#8217;m not casting aspersions on the new finance minister &#8221; Mantashe said. &#8220;They [finance ministers] always come out to be good &#8230; but the process has made me jittery and uncomfortable. The president knows the ANC is not happy with the changes &#8221; he said. Mantashe was pressed by Gwala to reveal where the list was developed and Mantashe repeatedly said he did not know. &#8220;I don&#8217;t know where the list was developed. The president has a right to invoke the constitutional process &#8230; The president just came with the list to us and said you can comment if you want to comment.&#8221; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
