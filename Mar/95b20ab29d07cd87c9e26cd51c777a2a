Three suspects were arrested shortly after breaking into a car parked in Cape Road, Mill Park on Thursday morning. Patrolling police officers arrested the men believed to be driving towards the owner s Lovemore Heights home &#8211; before the owner could even report the theft. Police spokesman Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said police pulled over the white Opel in Third Avenue, Newton Park. Three suspects were found inside. Police searched the vehicle and found a small bag containing a passport, identity book and house keys. With suspicions raised, the members tracked down the owner to inquire if he was aware that the men had his personal items, she said. To the man s surprise, he had just discovered that his car had been broken into and was en route to the police station to report it. The three suspects, who were arrested for theft and possession of stolen property, are expected to appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court on Friday.
