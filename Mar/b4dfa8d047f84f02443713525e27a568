One of the fake adverts The Eastern Cape Department of Health has distanced itself from job scams being advertised on the Gumtree website. The fake advert posted on Gumtree is inviting job seekers to apply for vacancies available at Bhisho Hospital and Port Elizabeth Provincial Hospital. Members of the public are encouraged to report such scams to the police. The matter has been reported to Bhisho Hospital and PE Provincial Hospital and attempts are being made to report the fake advert to Gumtree website administrators. The department has contacted the number listed in the fake advert and the person demanded or encouraged the applicant to bring an amount of R700 and application documents. The department said they have not and will never require payments from anyone applying for employment. For any available job opportunities at the Department of Health, job seekers are requested to visit their website at www.echealth.gov.za.
