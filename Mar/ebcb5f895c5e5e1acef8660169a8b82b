The Eastern Cape Department of Health has urged people not to apply for jobs that were advertised internally, saying that an employee had advertised vacancies that had not been approved. Department spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said their offices had been inundated with phone calls and CVs for the unauthorised positions. We are launching an internal investigation to find out how this happened, Kupelo said. We know it wasn t a mistake so we are trying to find out what the motives were. An official distributed a document containing a great number of unauthorised vacancies across the province. Kupelo said the posts included vacancies from doctors to administrative staff. These were shared by, and further distributed through, social media platforms and now the department is inundated with calls from prospective candidates, he said. We wish to advise members of the public that, as and when vacancies become available in the department, an official advertisement will be placed They will appear in appropriate advertising platforms such as the departmental website, DPSA [Department of Public Service and Administration] website and local and national newspapers. Members of the public are advised to ignore the illegal advert being circulated as it does not comply with any of our internal prescriptions and policies. Decisive action will be taken against any official who may have been involved in this misconduct once the internal investigation has been concluded.
