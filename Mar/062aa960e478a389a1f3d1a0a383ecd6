ALEX-NICO FERREIRA Picture: Supplied Gang murder trial set to go ahead despite death of student in northern areas ambush The devastated sister of a young northern areas man who was executed the star state witness in a gang murder case has told how a mortician had to stop her from counting the bullet wounds on her youngest brother s body last week. I counted seven before the mortician stopped me, Claudia Collins said yesterday. His killers wanted to make sure he was dead. The murder case in which Alex-Nico Ferreira, 27, was a Section 204 witness, involving two suspected gang members and a policeman who allegedly provided them with the gun, will proceed to trial despite his execution. While the prosecution has conceded that Ferreira s killing is a major setback for their case, his death has also been his family s biggest cross to bear. This is what happens to kids in the northern areas, Collins, 40, said. Ferreira was gunned down 2km from his parents Bethelsdorp home on the morning of February 21, just three months before he was due to testify against suspected gang members Enzo Kroates and Clement Kogana. One of his alleged shooters, Wayne Doefie Wabanie, appeared briefly in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court yesterday. The pending case was eating away at him [Ferreira], an emotional Collins said. It is not uncommon for witnesses to be silenced. It speaks to the situation in the northern areas. And in this matter there is a policeman [allegedly] involved. Corruption is the rotten underbelly of gangsterism in our neighbourhood. His murder was the devil s doing, but God allowed it to happen, we just don t understand why yet.
