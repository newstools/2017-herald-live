The sculptures, of animals, gods and mythical creatures, will decorate the spectacular 50m pyre that is set to provide a final stage for Bhumibol, who died last October. The exact date of his funeral is not yet known, with Bhumibol&#8217;s heir, King Maha Vajiralongkorn, to decide on an auspicious time, expected to be in late 2017. Thailand plunged into intense mourning for the passing Bhumibol, a monarch who strode over 70 years of Thai history. The new king will have his coronation after his father&#8217;s funeral, which promises to be a sombre yet magnificent affair heavily laced with symbols and ritual. At a cavernous studio an hour outside Bangkok dozens of artisans are making the huge, life-like sculptures which will stud the pyre, which is being built in Bangkok&#8217;s historic heart.

All of the artisans here are working with love and pride&#8230; we are doing it for our father,&#8221; he said, adding volunteers have boosted the ranks of the trained artisans. Resin moulds will be made from the finished clay sculptures. The works, two to four metres-high, include the Hindu god Brahma, elephants, lions and a towering Garuda a half-bird, half-human creature of Hindu and Buddhist lore which will carry Bhumibol&#8217;s spirit to Mount Meru. Meru is the allegorical centre of the universe in Buddhist, Hindu and Jain cosmology. Bhumibol&#8217;s body, currently in the Grand Palace, will be placed at the centre of the pyre and set alight allowing his spirit to travel to the mountain.
