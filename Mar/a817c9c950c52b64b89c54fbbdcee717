Actress Pearl Thusi is one of the celebrities whose name has been linked to the ANC &#8216;war room&#8216; saga which was allegedly set up to sway votes before the 2016 local government elections. Pearl&#8217;s name popped up on the full list of &#8216;war room&#8217; members when whistleblower and PR expert Sihle Bolani filed a second lawsuit against the ANC last week. Sihle first filed a R2.3-million lawsuit against the ruling party in January claiming that the party owed her for &#8220;services rendered&#8221;. However the matter was struck off the court roll but Sihle has filed another lawsuit for a whopping R4-million isn&#8217;t paid the R1 million promised to her as compromise. Sihle also claimed in court papers that Pearl was involved in a &#8216;Right To Vote&#8217; campaign which was part of the grand &#8216;war room&#8217; plan. TshisaLIVE recently sat down with the actress and had to ask about the fiasco. Pearl seemed dumbstruck by the allegations and claimed she knew nothing about the debacle. &#8220;Why do wanna tell me about a knife that someone is trying to stick in my back that I didn&#8217;t even know about? I don&#8217;t know anything about what you are saying or what you were about to say &#8221; she said. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
