PERFECT AIM: Alwyn van Jaarsveld, 10, in action in Port Elizabeth last week Picture: Supplied Alwyn van Jaarsveld, 10, became the youngest achiever as he shot a unique straight at the Eastern Province Clay Target Championships at the Port Elizabeth Clay Targets event last week. The Laer Volkskool pupil from Graaff Reinet, who competes in National Skeet Shooting Association events, started when he was eight years old and achieved a score many youngsters in his discipline have found difficult to reach. Alwyn is the youngest person in South Africa competing in his discipline. He achieved a straight in his first competitive event. He uses a 12-gauge shotgun and is coached by his father, Morne, who is a Proteas clay target shooter competing in the skeet discipline. Eastern Province Clay president Andre Nagel said: Honing such talent from an early age is very important. The boy has a tremendous amount of skill and technique and it is rare for someone his age to achieve such a thing. The sport is not very popular in other communities and we hope to bring in a lot of young people to start with development so they can compete nationally and eventually at the Olympics should they put in the required hard work. After shooting a straight, which is 25 out of 25 shots in a round in his first competition, as is customary his hat was shot at by other shooters at the event and was kept as a memento. Clay shooting is not an easy sport, his father said. It requires a lot of focus and continuous training. Alwyn has shown a lot of determination for someone his age. He has done something that seniors have found difficult to achieve. The talented shooter will be entering trials in an attempt to qualify for the Proteas team for next year s World Skeet Championships in San Antonio, Texas.
