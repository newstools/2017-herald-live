When I think of human rights, I think of our own, and my great hero, Steve Biko. What a tragic waste of an incredible human being. We needed him then and we need him even more today. I am so sorry that we white people and the despicable government of the day, by our very complacency, allowed this incredible human to be tortured and killed. I feel so pained about this loss that I would like to go to visit his family to apologise for our dastardly deed. The only way we can honour this great man is to follow his great example, and make this country a nation of peace and progress for all its people.
