This painting, by SA artist Conor Mccreedy, netted R400 000 at a Sotheby&#8217;s auction last week Picture: Supplied Hilton College old boy Conor Mccreedy &#8211; who s making waves on the New York art scene &#8211; had his depiction of the Indian Ocean auctioned by Sotheby s for more than R400 000. It was Mccreedy s debut auction with Sotheby s which raked in more than R300-million in sales of some of the world s biggest artists including Andy Warhol at its Contemporary Curated NYC auction last week. Conor Mccreedy Picture: Supplied Speaking from Switzerland Mccreedy said of his Indian Ocean Explosions painting: &#8220;I wasn&#8217;t sure what to expect as this was my debut with Sotheby s. But I was quite pleased to see multiple bidders and that it sold above the low estimate.&#8221; &#8220;I am honoured to be the youngest artist in the world who has been represented at this price point with Sotheby s.&#8221; Mccreedy excelled at art and sport at Hilton College in KwaZulu-Natal and went to the US in 2006 on a golf scholarship. But he succumbed a year later to the lure of art and also signed up as a model. In 2011 Mccreedy who mainly paints in blue and white completed a giant mural bearing the name Mandela on his New York apartment building. His unique style also landed him work with US television giant Time Warner Cable to capture its trademark on canvas. He secured the Time Warner work by chance after a marketing manager noticed his creations in a Manhattan gallery. The 30-year-old artist who four years ago had an artwork he painted in four days bought by an American collector for R1.8 million is now set for solo exhibitions at the Guggenheim Contemporary gallery in New York followed by Sardinia and Moscow. &#8211; TMG Digital/The Times Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
