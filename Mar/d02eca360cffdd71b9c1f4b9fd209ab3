R2-million was budgeted for upgrades at the Joe Slovo sports fields but the fencing has been vandalised and the resurfacing left halfway. Picture: Herald Photographer Incomplete or vandalised Bay facilities paint bleak picture Months after the scheduled completion dates, budget constraints have seen several Nelson Mandela Bay stadiums seemingly forgotten, with a number of half-built venues in a deteriorating state. In 2015, the municipality provided The Herald with a copy of a list documenting 48 proposed projects by its sport, recreation, arts and culture department for the 2015-16 budget. The cost of the projects totalled R104.5-million, with a minimum of R500 000 allocated to each. Sport received the biggest slice of the pie, banking R62.5-million for repairs, maintenance and refurbishments. About R30-million was set aside to upgrade and restore libraries, R9-million for beaches and resorts, and R500 000 for security at recreational buildings. However, follow-up visits last week to 23 of the stadiums which did not make it onto the department s 2016-17 budget costing list, painted a bleak picture of vandalised facilities, incomplete construction and an obvious lack of financial investment. The 2016-17 municipal sport, recreation, arts and culture list reflects 19 proposed projects 29 fewer than the year before. Despite many of the stadiums that were visited receiving boundary fencing and touch-ups to ablution and changing facilities, several fell short of the stipulated job specifications.
