Why do we have to go through all this heartache and sadness? Our president talks of a black party , referring to the ANC, whereas I know many white people voted ANC. The DA is perceived as a white party , yet my domestic worker and thousands with her turned to the DA from the ANC. We had a golden opportunity to take this country to great heights in 1994. It is so unnecessary when you hear and see blacks blaming whites (although they have a valid reason with the horrendous apartheid and all that went with it) and whites blaming blacks for all the crime and wrongdoing in our country. Criminals come in all colours, shapes and sizes. We need to close the chapter on the past evils, put our hands into the present with our eyes firmly fixed on our future. There is no strength in disunity. We all have to fight the common enemy, which is a corrupt government fraught with maladministration, filled with greedy fatcats only looking after themselves. Again our poor and vulnerable are the losers, no matter what race they are. This is not only about colour, it is about human survival. All the mudslinging and racist rants don t deserve any promotion, as, though we are aware of them, they simply help to enhance and exacerbate the situation. Negativity breeds negative thought, which eventually become our actions. As hard as it is, we have no choice but to work together, keep our eyes on the ball, use our muscle at the ballot box and vote in a government which will carry the hopes and dreams of our 55 million people. A pipe dream, you may say, but let s try and in everyone s small way, be a solution to the problem and not the cause. -Optimistic, Port Elizabeth Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
