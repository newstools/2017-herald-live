The ANC must not punish branches for its leadership preferences, whether it is on a national or provincial level. This is according to Sarah Baartman regional secretary Scara Njadayi following four cadres forums in Port Alfred, Jansenville, Paterson and Hankey this week. The forums are used to sharpen the political consciousness of ANC members and give branches an opportunity to interact with the national leadership. Njadayi said returning the power to general members in the various branches was key to developing unity in the organisation. The leaders spoke about radical economic transformation, but ours is to bring it close to our people, Njadayi said. ANC secretary-general Gwede Mantashe was in Port Alfred, deputy secretary-general Jessie Duarte was in Jansenville, treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize was in Paterson and NEC member Naledi Pandor was in Hankey for the four cadres forums. Following the forums, Njadayi said the region had come up with a plan. We are going to create a programme that will be sent to our municipalities. For example, if it is a plan to build RDP houses, we must empower the areas where those houses are to be built to manufacture building material like bricks and supply those bricks, sand and other material to the building sites, so that they not just a source of labour, he said. Njadayi said the region wanted all its municipalities within its boundaries to emulate the success of the Sarah Baartman Municipality. The party is also working hard to curb nepotism in recruitment in its municipalities. Njadayi said the region was also working on tackling corruption.
