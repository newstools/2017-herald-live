Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini has arrived at the Cape Sun where a crowd dressed in ANC colours welcomed her with song. &#8220;Viva ANC Women&#8217;s president Viva!&#8221; they screamed. The minister has come under fire in recent days for her handling of the Sassa payment crisis. Among the crowd were people in wheelchairs and pastors in church garb. While people are reluctant to say who summoned them to the four star hotel it is understood that Dlamini will reassure them that they will receive payment of their state grants. Her department has been mired in controversy over the possibility that 17-million beneficiaries might not get paid. The contract between the department and Cash Paymaster Services was declared illegal by the Constitutional Court. It will lapse on March 31. However a new deal with CPS and the department is on the table. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
