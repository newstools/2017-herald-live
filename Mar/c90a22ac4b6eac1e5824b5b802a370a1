My family have needed to apply for ID documents and marriage certificates, and renew passports several times in the past year. On each occasion we went to Department of Home Affairs in Uitenhage. Each and every visit has been a pleasant experience, with my passport renewal application on February 23 being, so far, the best example of customer service to date. I was in and out of the office within 20 minutes, having completed my passport renewal application and obtained an abridged marriage certificate. The office was spotless, and staff neatly dressed, competent and friendly. A real example to all businesses in South Africa, especially to our government institutions. Please take a leaf from the Home Affairs Uitenhage s example! Thank you to you and your team. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
