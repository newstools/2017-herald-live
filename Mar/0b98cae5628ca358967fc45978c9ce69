Meanwhile his co-accused Thando Sonqishe the man who appeared in social media with a multi-million-rand Lamborghini said that if he stayed in jail he would contact diseases given the poor state of prison facilities. Sonqishe&#8217;s lawyer Victor Nkwashu told the court that his client could also afford R30,000 bail. &#8220;My client was embarrassed by the manner in which the police handled his arrest and publicised in in the media.
