Grant Snyman is to perform at the Carnegie Hall in New York Port Elizabeth clarinetist Grant Snyman is set to grace the stage of the famous Carnegie Hall in New York City in the US next week. Snyman, 24, is the clarinet and saxophone teacher at Collegiate Girls High School in the Bay. He is also a final-year M Mus conducting student at NMMU. Snyman was chosen as first clarinetist and shadow conductor for the KZN Youth Wind Band, which will be competing at the International New York Wind Band Festival in New York from March 10 to 16. We are extremely proud of Grant and wish him well as he is not only an ambassador for the school but also the country, Collegiate Girls High School head of music Nikki Fyvie said. The KZN Youth Wind Band, under the direction of Russell Scott, is one of only six wind ensembles selected out of 36 international applicants to participate in the festival. The band is also the only participating ensemble from South Africa and the continent. The band will perform the world premiere of a newly commissioned work written for them. This is truly a dream come true, Snyman said this week. I never thought I would ever receive an opportunity of this magnitude. I am truly grateful to Russell Scott and to the KZN Youth Wind Band as this is a concert venue that most musicians only ever dream about performing in.
