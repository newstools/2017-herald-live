The University of Cape Town&#8217;s academic year is set to start on March 13. According to a statement by the institution the late start is as a result of several programmes such as a mini semester and differed exams which were implemented to complete the 2016 academic year. The university was at the centre of bruising #FeesMustFall protests last year. Despite the turmoil the university emphasised that it remains the top ranking university in Africa. In addition it recorded the highest number of National Research Foundation related researchers in the country. The institution has been flooded with applications.
