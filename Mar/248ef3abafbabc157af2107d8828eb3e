This year s African Championship race will be the most exciting event they have hosted to date, Ironman South Africa communications officer Michael Flanagan said. The competition takes place at Hobie Beach in Summerstrand on Sunday. A total of 2 830 athletes, of whom 700 are international, will be participating in this year s triathlon. The field also includes 73 professional athletes, which Flanagan regards as the strongest the race has ever had. The pros will be vying for a share of the R1 940 625 prize money and world championship qualification points. It is always the strongest field in the world apart from the world championships, Flanagan said. On the women s side we have the world champion, Daniela Ryf, of Switzerland. We also have three of the five regional champions racing Jodie Swallow, Kaisa Lehtonen and Julia Gajer. In the men s field we have the last three champions from the previous races Nils Frommhold, Frederik van Lierde and Ben Hoffman and our South African pros as well James Cunnama and Kyle Buckingham. The live television coverage from SuperSport for 17 hours would be the biggest Ironman broadcast anywhere in the world, Flanagan said.
