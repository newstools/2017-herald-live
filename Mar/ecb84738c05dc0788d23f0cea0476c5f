Trust Twitter to find the light-hearted side of any situation including the multi-million rand heist at OR Tambo International that has hogged headlines this week. While the heist isn&#8217;t a laughing matter Twitter thinks its funny and has the potential to be turned into a movie. After the initial shock of the incident wore off users have flooded the social media platform with side-splitting memes and comments.

(@JusFeez) March 8, 2017 As usual Twitter CSI attempted to investigate the crime and we know by now they never come up empty-ended. Their findings would not be helpful to the actual case but they found suspects and one of the names that popped up was Maps Maponyane. Twitter detectives should take over the case! I am pretty sure they will get to the bottom of this #ORTamboRobbery &mdash; Kgaugelo Masweneng (@KgaugeloKgaphol) March 9, 2017 Maps tweeted that he had a big night ahead on the day of the heist and later tweeted to thank tweeps who had wished him luck. Of course he was not talking about the heist but Twitter detectives put his tweet and the timing of the heist together. The TV star laughed off Twitter detectives insinuations and played along asking followers how much money they wanted. https://twitter.com/KabeloNgwane/status/839487734716776448/photo/1?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw pic.twitter.com/ZHIyER7fQE &mdash; The Analyst (@KabeloNgwane) March 8, 2017 https://t.co/UPsLeAP44i &mdash; Maps Maponyane (@MapsMaponyane) March 8, 2017 Eish, okay fine ke!
