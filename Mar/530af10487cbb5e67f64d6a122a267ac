Well, technically everything adds up fast these days, the economy better make a quick turnaround or people will need to take out loans for milk and bread. I don t want to have to put a down payment on eggs, people! Avocado prices are bad enough &#8230; But I digress, it s my son s birthday next week and like with most things in my life, I like to look at ways to make things easier and cheaper while sticking to a theme. My soon-to-be four-year-old suggested that I only give out three party packs and he will just remind the other kids that he loves them too. In lieu of that, I chatted to kiddies party planner Tanya Bekker of Monkey Magic Functions who gave me a few ideas. Candy necklaces come in bulk packs and can add a fancy effect to a princess-themed party without breaking the bank; Bulk jelly sweets are a cheaper option and you can decant it into smaller, themed packages; Mini biscuits, such as mini cheddars and mini Marie biscuits, are always a winner and can be bought in packs of six; Party bags of chocolate like smarties or chomps are a cute addition and the serving sizes are not too big; Lollipops are also not very expensive and can be bought in a colour that matches the theme. Dealing with pre-diabetes myself, I try to stay away from too much refined sugar and will substitute some of the sweets with something healthier (not all of the sweets, it s a party after all). Some of my healthier options are: Small boxes/packs of raisins; Apples as they are healthy, tasty and rather durable (durability is good with preschoolers); Lightly salted pretzels; Homemade cookies or mini muffins; Trade the juice for milk or water; Fruit rolls.
