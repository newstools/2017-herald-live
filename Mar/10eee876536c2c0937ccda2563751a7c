The Cape Town Cycle tour has been cancelled due to adverse weather conditions and protests along the route. The first four groups that left will be turning around at M3 and Steenberg now and heading back to town. On Saturday organisers said they had been advised of the possibility of severe winds and warned the 35 000 riders to stay away if they are not comfortable riding in strong winds. In 2009 the race was plagued by a gale-force southeasterly wind that played havoc with portable toilets scaffolding sponsors billboards and anything else that was not nailed down. Helicopters were grounded resulting in no live TV coverage. This year&#8217;s 109km circuit of the Cape peninsula marks the cycle tour&#8217;s 40th anniversary. &#8211; More to follow.
