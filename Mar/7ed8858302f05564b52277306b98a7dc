Judge Siraj Desai has ruled that unattended video cameras in discrete locations may be set up in court to film the trial of Henri van Breda. Media24 brought an application to live-stream proceedings. But Van Breda&#8217;s counsel Piet Botha said he has to consult with his client. Desai agreed and court was adjourned for a short while. The steps of the high court in Cape Town were swarming with local and foreign press. A dozen cameramen including Australian news broadcaster News 7 waited patiently for Desai&#8217;s decision. Photographers are still waiting for a shot of the 22-year-old to arrive at court. Van Breda is accused of murdering his father Martin mother Teresa and brother Rudi with an axe in January 2015. His sister Marli survived the attack but sustained serious injuries. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
