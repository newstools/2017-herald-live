&nbsp; The paternity of kidnapped baby Siwaphiwe was thrust into the spotlight as her mother and the mother&#8217;s her secret lover appeared in the Durban Magistrate s Court on Monday (13/03/17). The court heard that DNA testing would be conducted to determine the identity of the one-month-old girl s father. The mother whose face was concealed with a scarf and her boyfriend in a formal blue jacket faced ranks of cameras in the packed court gallery. Missing was a third person who was arrested with the boyfriend as he was returning the child to Durban between midnight and 1am on Sunday morning near the Mariannhill Toll Plaza. The woman was not charged. The state is also still in the process of formulating a full set of charges against the pair who appeared in court on Monday. Shortly after the case was adjourned the wife s husband refused to comment on the DNA testing and the possible identify of the baby s father. He rebuffed journalists before lashing out at a cameraman. &nbsp; Baby Siwaphiwe was snatched on Friday afternoon in what turned out to be a staged hijacking. She was missing for 48 hours before she was saved by police who intercepted a car she was being transported in. The suspects will appear in court again on Wednesday.
