Coach Zane Bosch wants to see an improved defence from the FNB NMMU-Madibaz Young Guns in their crucial Varsity Cup rugby encounter against UCT on the NMMU B field on Monday. With only one match under their belts an opening loss to Stellenbosch the Madibaz have had precious little game time this season, but Bosch said it had given them an opportunity to work on their skills. Unfortunately, we got off to a bit of a late start and only had three weeks of preparation before the Maties game, the Madibaz coach said. He said Stellenbosch were a powerful unit with several SA Schools players in their ranks and they had taken some positives from the match. We did well in our lineouts and scrums and were good with the ball in hand, but our defence was lacking, he said. However, that was our first game and we have put in a lot of work in that department. We have also been working hard on our skills over the past three weeks. Following the 79-20 defeat, he said victory would be crucial against Ikeys on Monday as the three pool winners, plus the best-placed second team from the pools, would qualify for the semifinals.
