Janine Samuels Suicide pretender who stole from client gets five years A small-town bookkeeper who stole more than R200 000 from an elderly client and then faked her own death a day before her court appearance, pretending to have committed suicide, has been sentenced to five years in prison by the Port Elizabeth Commercial Crimes Court. The petite Janine Samuels, 34, took to the stand yesterday, where she spun a tragic story of a sad past and an abusive relationship. Samuels, of Willomore, said she had even lost her baby at eight weeks old after she contracted an infection during her pregnancy because of the stress of the case. She said she had absconded from court on numerous occasions to try to raise enough money to reimburse her victim, hoping this would result in lenience. She was re-arrested and her bail finally forfeited in October last year, after an e-mail was sent to her attorney at the time, claiming that Janine Samuels is dead . She has been in custody since. Yesterday, defence attorney Gary Botha said she had shown remorse and so badly wanted to pay back the money that she had risked arrest by skipping court. Samuels, meanwhile, said she had spent a large chunk of the stolen money on nonsense , such as an ex-boyfriend and airtime, and the rest had been spent on her seven-year-old son, who has a learning disability. Samuels was arrested in January 2015, after she stole from Willomore resident Frances Erasmus.
