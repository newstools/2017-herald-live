Dan Brown has finished his new Robert Langdon thriller Origin, which is due to hit the shelves on October 3. Brown is the author of the blockbuster hit The Da Vinci Code and three others since it was published in 2003. The most recent Langdon novel, 2013 s Inferno, was panned by critics but raked in readers and millions in copy sales. Described as the master of the intellectual cliffhanger , the new book will be in keeping with Brown s trademark style, interweaving codes, science, religion, history, art and architecture. Origin thrusts Harvard symbologist Langdon into the dangerous intersection of humankind s two most enduring questions, and the earth-shaking discovery that will answer them. It will be published by Penguin Random House in South Africa. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
