Christopher Mbambo is pleading for anyone with information regarding his baby Siwaphiwe&#8217;s disappearance to come forward Picture: Supplied The search continues for a one-month old baby who was in a car when it was hijacked in Durban on Friday Picture: Supplied Christopher Mbambo just wants his litlte girl back in his arms. He was speaking to journalists outside the Durban Central police station on Saturday afternoon almost exactly 24 hours after his daughter one-month-old Siwaphiwe was taken in an apparent hijacking near the City View shopping centre in Greyville Durban. Despite extensive search efforts there was no sign of the little girl. &#8220;What I am asking for from all people is that whoever hears where the baby is please let the police know where this baby that belongs to the Mbambos [is]. When they hear of anything they must contact the police so that we can get assistance as a family. Please help us. That&#8217;s all I&#8217;m asking for. Even you as the media please work with the Mbambo family in this undesirable circumstance &#8221; the tearful father said. His wife Sibongile Mbambo was too traumatised to speak to the media. SAPS spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Thulani Zwane said the search was continuing. &#8211; TMG Digital/TimesLIVE Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
