Port Elizabeth pop-rocker Alan Kozak will perform at the Music Kitchen in Newton Park on Monday, March 20. Kozak will play original music he has written and arranged over a number of years. He would like to record his music collection and the funds raised will go towards the recording. Kozak will be supported by friends Devon van Rooyen, Debbie Everard and Therese Smith also playing pop-rock. His equally talented brother Brent Kozak will open the show with Lorette Pagel with their original blend of folk and accoustic sounds. The show starts at 8pm and tickets cost R100.
