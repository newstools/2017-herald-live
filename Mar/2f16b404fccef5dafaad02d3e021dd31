Police have arrested four people including a policeman in connection with last week&#8217;s daring heist at OR Tambo International Airport in Johannesburg. National police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane revealed this at a briefing this evening. Two of the suspects have already appeared in the Kempton Park Magistrate&#8217;s Court. He declined to elaborate on who the suspects were their identities or anything on the police officer. &#8220;The policeman is still being questioned and has not yet appeared in court.&#8221; He said they could not rule out whether more police officers would be arrested. &#8220;What I can say is that two men appeared in court today on charges of armed robbery.&#8221; &#8211; TMG Digital/TimesLIVE Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
