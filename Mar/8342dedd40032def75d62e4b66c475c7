Black South Easter are in the Bay this weekend Black South Easter, a four-piece outfit from Cape Town, will headline an evening of jiving soul and rocking reggae at the Music Kitchen in Port Elizabeth on Friday night. Easy Breeze SoundSystem is presenting the cross-over musical fusion evening at the Newton Park venue, which also features Skank and The Roots from Uitenhage and Port Elizabeth duo Umle. The Capetonian quartet plays a progressive South African groove and take their name from the wind that blow across the Cape Peninsula. Those who have been to one of their concerts before will know that the band s live shows generate a powerful energy, transporting their audience on a soulful journey to the tune of original Afro-fusion sounds. Vocalist Nhoza Sitsholwana comes from a family of vocalists in the rural Eastern Cape, launching her career at the age of 17 as a backing vocalist for Simphiwe Dana. Her powerful voice incorporates rich blues tones with elements of traditional African soul music. Bassist Jimi Curve brings a pulsating groove to the outfit and has been a stalwart on the live music scene for the past 15 years, playing with a host of well-known artists, including Steve Newman and Arno Carstens. Mozambican drummer Jerry Mbowa delivers a seasoned palette of Pan-African beats to the music and has toured extensively with the likes of The Sons of Selassie, among others. Guitarist Dan Boshoff uses unusual tunings and progressions to bring an original colour to the music. On Saturday, Black South Easter head to Riebeeck East for the quirkily named Ballasbak Festival. The Music Kitchen is at 69 Mangold Street in Newton Park and the gig starts at 7.30pm. Tickets are R100 each. More information phone 072-994-5096.
