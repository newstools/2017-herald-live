Spekboom &#8211; that food so loved by the elephants at Addo and written about last week by Beth Cooper Howell in Woman on Top is also a tasty addition to this simple stir-fry. This recipe is by Sally-Ann Creed, co-author of The Real Meal Revolution, the Banting book, which revolutionised the way many South African families look at food. It is in her latest cookery book, Delicious Low Carb, which aims to give healthy, affordable and practical recipes for low-carb living. Even though the 100 or so recipes minimise the use of grains, carbohydrates and sugar, they are packed with flavour. Creed s advice is simple: buy fresh, unprocessed food and prepare it in your own kitchen. Leave the energy bars, shop-bought biscuits, fizzy drinks and boxed cereals.
