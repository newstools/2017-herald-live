Councillors demand answers after bleak picture emerges of municipality failing to act The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality has failed to implement strategies to combat fraud and corruption in the past year, with councillors alarmed at the lack of progress in finalising forensic investigations. In the 2015-16 auditor-general report for the municipality, officials revealed that since 2011 attempts to conduct anti-fraud and anti-corruption strategy meetings had failed. The failure to finalise forensic investigations was also linked to staff shortages in the Internal Audit and Risk Assurance department. Councillors yesterday demanded at a municipal public accounts committee (MPAC) meeting a full report on what has been done by the city to implement the anti-fraud and anticorruption strategy. They also want an update on all current forensic investigations. A section titled Internal Audit in the auditor-general report painted a bleak picture, showing that for more than five years recommendations set out in investigations of fraud and corruption were not actioned. Former attempts to conduct antifraud and anti-corruption awareness programmes with the council were rendered fruitless, as scheduled awareness sessions were very poorly attended by political office bearers including MPAC members, the report said.
