Former EP Rugby president Cheeky Watson, Nadia Gerwel, Andrea Wessels, along with her company Zeranza and Mandisa Mkaza have each been released on R2000 bail in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate&#8217;s Court on Friday morning. State advocate Tjaart van Zyl said the accused face 43 counts totalling R12-million for &#8220;circumventing the procurement process between the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality, National Treasury and Access Management&#8221;. The accused were arrested by the Hawks on Friday morning (31/03/17) and appeared in court shortly after. Charges include fraud and money laundering. Spokesman Lieutenant Colonel Robert Netshiunda said the Hawks are investigating corrupt activities around the R208 million which the National Treasury had approved in 2007 for the improvement of the Integrated Public Transport System at the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality. &#8220;Initial investigations have revealed that the four suspects have diverted an amount of R12 million and used it for personal gain&#8217;, Netshiunda said. The state said it was not opposed to bail because the accused have no previous convictions and all have fixed addresses. The case was postponed to May 3 for further investigation and for the arrest of an outstanding accused who is not in the city. The Hawks arrested former EP rugby president Cheeky Watson along with Nadia Gerwel Andrea Wessels and Mandisa Mkaza in Port Elizabeth on charges of fraud or corruption.
