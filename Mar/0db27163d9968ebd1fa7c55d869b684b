Amier Moosagie File picture: B-Jay Piercey The case against convicted fraudster Amier Moosagie took a surprise twist this week when the state said it wanted to return the fugitive millionaire s restrained assets and the police admitted their hunt for Moosagie had come to an end. The National Director of Public Prosecutions (NDPP) said it was costing too much to hold onto the restrained goods. Moosagie, 64, of Malabar, took flight on Christmas Day four years ago before the Port Elizabeth High Court could sentence him on charges of tax fraud, forgery, money laundering and racketeering involving more than R3-million. His co-accused, Desiree Jenkins, was sentenced to an effective 10 years in prison for her part in the offence. But now, and although the businessman is still missing, the state wants to release the assets restrained by the Asset Forfeiture Unit in March 2014. Advocate Nkululeko Ndzengu, a deputy director of public prosecutions in the Eastern Cape, said when comparing the value of the assets to the curator fees incurred, it was no longer viable for the state to pursue a confiscation order. Meanwhile, provincial police spokeswoman Colonel Sibongile Soci said Interpol had confirmed that they did not have a file on Moosagie.
