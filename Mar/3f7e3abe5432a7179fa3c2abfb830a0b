A 50-year-old woman died when the house she was in burnt to the ground on Sunday afternoon (05/03/17). Police spokesman Warrant Officer Alwin Labans said the woman was alone at the home in Harris Street, South End, while her husband was out. According to neighbours the deceased was blind. While details surrounding the fire are minimal but neighbours reported seeing smoke coming from the house at about 1pm. The residence was completely gutted in less than a hour. &#8220;At this stage we still don&#8217;t know what caused the fire,&#8221; said Labans. Emergency services extinguished two fires in Baakens Valley this afternoon. Currently the two incidents seem unrelated. The name of the woman is not being released by police until her next of kin have been notified. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
