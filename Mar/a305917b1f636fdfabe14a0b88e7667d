A Humansdorp boy has become an internet sensation, with his rendition of Meghan Trainor s Like I m Gonna Lose You reaching nearly 50 000 views on Facebook yesterday. Diego Lottering, 12, uploaded the video on Tuesday, hoping to raise some money for an upcoming school tour. He got his wish enough money to go on Graslaagte Primary School s annual Grade 7 tour and more. The video so inspired Khoi Kulcha clothing brand s managing director, Rochey Walters, that he not only paid for the trip but also helped Diego secure a gig at The Boardwalk in Port Elizabeth next month. Diego, who is in the school choir, said he had been singing since the age of six. I just started singing, it just kind of happened. At the time my favourite singer was Whitney Houston, then Meghan Trainor and then Taylor Swift I just love her songs, he said. My favourite song is the one I sang in the video because I used to love Meghan Trainor, but now I don t because she s all about the paparazzi. Walters was so moved by Diego s talent, he donated the amount needed for his school tour. A friend of mine sent me the video and I was like, wow! Then I realised that this boy goes to the same school I came from.
