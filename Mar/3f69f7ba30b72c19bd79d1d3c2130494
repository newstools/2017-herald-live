Nelson Mandela Metropolitan Art Museum former director Dr Melanie Hillebrand will give a talk Understanding Art on Monday, March 6 at 6pm at Art on Target, 2 Target Kloof. The presentation is an overview of workshops she will be offering from the end of March through to June. Baffled by -isms, concepts and motifs, intimidated by impenetrable jargon? writes the experienced art historian and practicing artist in her brief on the upcoming workshops. I am offering a straightforward introduction to the art of reading art. Being able to read images is a skill, whether it s in order to understand 17th century oil painting, a 20th century conceptual installation, a poster design , your favourite cartoon or the decorations on a tea cup. I want my skills and methods to encourage you to have confidence in your ability to understand a broad spectrum of artworks so that you can make art an everyday event. The talk is free and open to the public so your colleagues, friends and family are welcome. Inquiries: BA, (041) 373-3334, 083-728-5295.
