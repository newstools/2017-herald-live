Chippa United coach Dan Dance Malesela was admitted to a Port Elizabeth hospital with a suspected heart problem yesterday. Chairman Chippa Mpengesi confirmed to DispatchLIVE that Malesela did not travel with the team that will play against Bidvest Wits in the Premier Soccer League at Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane tomorrow night. Mpengesi said they were still shocked by the former Orlando Pirates and Mamelodi Sundowns player&#8217;s hospitalisation. This is painful to all of us, but unfortunately, it&#8217;s beyond our control. He felt the pain in his chest yesterday (Sunday) in training and went to see a doctor. I spoke to him and he told me about the pain but after an hour, I heard that his condition became serious and was taken to hospital. I think it&#8217;s something to do with his heart but I&#8217;m not sure, but it&#8217;s got to do with a heart condition, he said. We are so sad and shocked by this but we can&#8217;t control God&#8217;s will. We wish him a speedy recovery. The animated coach, who hardly ever sits down for the entire 90 minutes, fell ill just days after his side went down 2-1 against Platinum Stars on Friday night. Assistant coach Mbuyiselo Sambu will be in charge of the team in tomorrow&#8217;s PSL game against Wits. &nbsp; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
