More than 30 gangsters have been convicted of various crimes over the past 11 months and will spend an accumulative 529 years behind bars. This was revealed yesterday at a recognition ceremony at the Mount Road Police Station for prosecutors and police officers who deal specifically with gang-related crimes. Mount Road Cluster commander Major-General Funeka Siganga who oversees seven police stations in the Bay handed over certificates of appreciation to both state prosecutors and police gang unit members who have assisted in securing the arrests and convictions. Siganga highlighted the successes of the team, saying they were because of collaboration with the National Prosecuting Authority. The relationship forged between the provincial gang investigation unit and the prosecuting authority is unique and is a practice that should be adopted by all investigators to ensure communities do not lose faith in the police and justice system. Siganga said criminals in the gangridden northern areas tormented the communities in which they lived. Gang investigation unit commander Lieutenant Colonel Mike Grobler said that even when cases were on the brink of collapse mainly due to witnesses recanting statements or being killed they still managed to get convictions. This is because we all work so well together. It is so reassuring knowing you can call the prosecutors for advice at any time. Deputy Director of Public Prosecutions Advocate Indra Goberdan said she had four prosecutors working with detectives on gang cases. Brigadier Keith Meyer said: This is the best team in the country. The level of enthusiasm is amazing. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
