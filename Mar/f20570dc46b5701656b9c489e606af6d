ALMOST EXTINCT: The Albany adder Picture: MICHAEL ADAMS A new game reserve is on the cards for the Algoa Bay region to protect what could be the planet s rarest snake. If the Endangered Wildlife Trust (EWT) was successful in its bid to protect the Albany adder, it would be the first reserve in Africa, if not the world, dedicated to protecting a critically endangered snake, EWT field officer Michael Adams said. The US-based Rainforest Trust has come on board as a sponsor for the purchase of the land, once it is identified and approved by the authorities. Discussions are under way with the International Union for the Conservation of Nature s viper specialist group and further support has come from Bayworld herpetologist Werner Conradie. While the Caribbean St Lucia racer was previously considered to be the world s rarest snake, with just 18-100 specimens left, there are far fewer Albany adders. The reserve project is premised on the discovery of two Albany adder specimens after zero sightings for nearly a decade the cut-off point at which a species is officially declared extinct. A stubby little snake that feeds on lizards, it was first described in 1935 by the then curator of Grahamstown s Albany Museum, John Hewitt, and its range was established to be the Albany district between Port Elizabeth and Addo. But after just 11 more sightings, the last in 2007, a total of 12 in all, there were concerns that it might already be extinct, Adams said. Guided by input from Conradie and Port Elizabeth herpetologist Dr Bill Branch, an EWT team visited the area in September to try to establish if there were any more specimens to be found.
