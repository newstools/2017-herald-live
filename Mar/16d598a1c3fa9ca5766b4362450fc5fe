Andile Lungisa Picture: Vathiswa Ruselo / Gallo Images / Sowetan Bid to become ANC chairman in Bay dealt blow as national leaders bar him for still being PEC member Andile Lungisa s bid for the ANC s top spot in Nelson Mandela Bay was dealt a blow as it emerged the party s national leaders would not as per the ANC s constitution allow him to contest the chairmanship this weekend. Lungisa, who has been campaigning furiously ahead of the regional conference set to start today, is still a member of the ANC s provincial executive committee (PEC) and is thus barred by the party s constitution from serving on a lower structure. In a letter sent to all provincial structures across the country on Wednesday, secretary-general Gwede Mantashe wrote that any attempt to resign from the PEC to be able to stand for a position at a regional conference should not be allowed. The letter read: Any attempt to resign must not be allowed as it is opportunistic. Any province having problems with this resolution must propose an amendment of the constitution in the national conference or at least raise the issue in the NEC. But Lungisa challenged Mantashe s letter, saying the constitution also allowed members to participate and be elected in any structure of the ANC. No particular clause must be used selectively. It is wrong for anyone to use the ANC constitution to serve a particular grouping and micro manage the organisation, Lungisa said. If ANC branches want me to serve in a sub-region, I will. If [they want me to serve] in the region, I will also do. Lungisa is associated with the premier league, a grouping of ANC provincial chairmen comprising the likes of Ace Magashule, Supra Mahumapelo and David Mabuza.
