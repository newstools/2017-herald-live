It is this beauty that has put the social development project in line to win the annual Design Indaba s Most Beautiful Object in South Africa award. The centre is up against 10 other objects and is the only nominee from the Eastern Cape. Community architect and project manager Kevin Kimwelle said the centre, along with the greater project it forms part of, directly addressed the social conflicts of the Joe Slovo community. And the beauty of that project runs far deeper than the gorgeous creche, as it is helping empower a whole community. Kimwelle hopes people will vote for the creche so their message of making a difference through empowerment will be heard. We were nominated by a lady who saw our centre on TV and we are the only nominee that addresses social issues and social change. The [project] consists of a youth centre, a specialised school and frailcare centre, the creche and a science centre, he said. We also assist Joe Slovo residents by empowering them with a skills set which they are able to impart back to the community. Kimwelle said the R1.1-million project had grown immensely thanks to scores of benefactors. The creche was built in conjunction with a number of young French architects from the Collective Saga and Engineering Without Borders, among others.
