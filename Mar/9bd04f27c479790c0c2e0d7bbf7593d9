HELPING OUT: Sisters Savanah, 9, right, and Hope Meyers, 6, are taking part in the IronKids event and raising money for the Smile Foundation at the same time Picture: FREDLIN ADRIAAN IronKids contestants hope to raise R40 000 to help less fortunate They want to help more children smile, say the little heroes who will swim, run and cycle tomorrow to raise money for the Smile Foundation. Taking part in the IronKids section of the Ironman competition this weekend are 23 youngsters who aim to raise R40 000 for children in need of facial surgery. Summerwood Primary School sisters Savanah, 9, and Hope Meyers, 6, have already raised R4 150 and would like to see that figure rise. Savanah said she hoped more people would pledge donations as she and her sister just wanted to see more children smiling. My mom made a YouTube video of us and we asked everyone to help us to raise money, she said. We want to help other kids smile, we want them to be happy. Smile Foundation project manager Tanya Jackson said the foundation helped countless South African children born with facial conditions including cleft lips and palates, Moebius syndrome (a neurological disorder characterised by weakness or paralysis) and burn victims. She said the foundation hosted a Smile Week annually and invited children who participated in the IronKids competition to meet the children who had benefited from their fundraising efforts. Children helping children is the idea behind the initiative, with 23 children aged between six and 13 participating in the event as part of the Smile IronKids team.
