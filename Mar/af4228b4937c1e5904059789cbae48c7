The father of missing Durban baby Siwaphiwe Mbambo arrived at the Durban Central Police station on Sunday in search of his child. Christopher Mbambo cut a tired figure as he trudged into the police station. He refused to answer questions when approached by TMG Digital, saying that he would press charges if he was not left alone. His wife, her boyfriend and another woman were arrested in the early hours of the morning. Siwaphiwe was handed to police at the Mariannhill Toll Plaza. Police spokeswoman Brigadier Sally de Beer said serious discrepancies had arisen while interviewing the mother, which later led to her arrest. This is a developing story.
