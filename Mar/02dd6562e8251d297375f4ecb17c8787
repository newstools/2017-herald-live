Days after Ford SA chief executive Jeffery Nemeth was summoned to the vehicle manufacturer s headquarters in the US the company has recalled 1 078 Ford Fiesta ST cars in South Africa. The safety recall affects models manufactured between September 2012 and December 2014. In the affected vehicles a lack of coolant circulation could cause an engine to overheat resulting in a crack in the cylinder head, Nemeth said last night. A cracked cylinder head can result in a pressurised oil leak. Oil that comes into contact with a hot engine surface increases the risk of a fire in the engine compartment. The safety of our customers is our top priority and the expansion of the safety recall is being rolled out as a precautionary measure on the Fiesta ST, he said. The recall comes days after the Sunday Times reported that insurers Auto &amp; General and Dialdirect were to take legal action against Ford in connection with fires which have destroyed several Ford EcoSport SUVs. Ford has claimed that it is aware of only one fire incident involving an EcoSport. Nemeth has denied that his return to the US has anything to do with the Ford Kuga safety recall.
