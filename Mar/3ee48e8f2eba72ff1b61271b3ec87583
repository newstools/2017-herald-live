Exercise equipment removed from an outdoor trim gym on Hobie Beach yesterday to make way for the 2018 Ironman 70.3 World Championship has left Port Elizabeth gym bunnies hopping mad. Residents were left shocked when the equipment was removed by municipal workers. The outdoor trim gym in Summerstrand had a triple air walker, spinning bike and push pull-up chair combo. Municipal spokesman Mzobanzi Jikazana said the municipality would identify an alternative venue for the equipment. We had to remove the equipment as it was on a transition area for Ironman, Jikazana said. The 2018 Ironman 70.3 World Championship will take place in September. Ironman South Africa spokesman Michael Flanagan said the gym equipment had been on an important area already demarcated as an event site for the competition. As part of the ongoing inspections for the city s state of readiness to host the world championship, the global organising team will be conducting inspections on the site in April over the Ironman African Championship period and the host city needs to ensure that the terms of the bid are met, he said. But this did not sit well with residents who criticised the municipality for poor planning and wasting money. Ntomboxolo Myathaza, 34, said: They knew from last year when the equipment was put here that there is also Ironman. It s not like it is the first time that the municipality is hosting an Ironman. Charles Minaar, 55, who was equally surprised, said he had started using the trim gym in December. We can hardly afford the gym and this is a community area where you can freely work out.
