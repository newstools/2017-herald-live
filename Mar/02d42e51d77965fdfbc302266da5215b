Two men were caught just three hours after allegedly stealing a Volkswagen Citi Golf in Uitenhage. Police arrested the two 24-year-old men travelling in the vehicle, shortly after the owner had reported it missing. Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said KwaNobuhle police officers caught the men at about 8am on Tuesday after the car had been stolen in Enwright Street at about 5am. The vehicle was reported stolen to the Uitenhage police station. The theft was circulated by the radio control centre, Swart said. Members on patrol spotted the Golf minutes later in Msidare Street, KwaNobuhle. A brief car chase ensued and the men were arrested. Swart said the men forced the driver s door open by breaking the lock and used an Allen key to start the car. Vehicles, particularly older model cars, should have anti-theft devices installed, Swart said. Uitenhage station commander Brigadier Laurence Soekoe said they were attempting to establish whether the men could be linked to other cases. In another incident the same day, Hankey police arrested three men, aged between 20 and 25, after they were spotted in a stolen Ford Fiesta. Police tested the registration number of the vehicle, which had been taken during an armed robbery close to the beach in Pellsrus, Jeffreys Bay, on Sunday, Swart said. All five are due to appear in court today. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
