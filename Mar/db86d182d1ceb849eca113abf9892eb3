Peter Loyson Professor Peter Loyson of NMMU s chemistry department has written a book entitled Early Pharmacy Teaching in Port Elizabeth The Story of the Diploma in Pharmacy, which was launched during a function at the offices of the Pharmaceutical Society of South Africa (Cape Midlands Branch) on February 27. It traces the teaching of pharmacy in Port Elizabeth from its very beginnings in 1928 at the Technical College in Russell Road to the final years of the diploma course at the Port Elizabeth Technikon in the late 1980s, signifying the end of the School of Pharmacy at the Technikon. In 1983, students registered for the B.Pharm degree at the university. This book will be of interest to past students and lecturing staff of the Diploma in Pharmacy in PE, those interested in teaching pharmacy in South Africa and historians of pharmacy education. A copy of the book, which costs R100, can be obtained from Mellis Moorcroft, director of the Pharmaceutical Society of SA (Cape Midland Branch), at Deloitte Place, Ascot Office Park, Conyngham Road, Greenacres, or call (041)373-3947 or e-mail: cmbpssa@intekom.co.za Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
