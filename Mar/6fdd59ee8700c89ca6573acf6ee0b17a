Jayde Bailey has been sentenced to five years for distributing child porn Just minutes after being sentenced to an effective five years behind bars, a man &#8211; found guilty of distributing child pornography &#8211; was already out on bail. Jayde Sheldon Bailey was sentenced in the Port Elizabeth Regional Court on Thursday morning (09/03/17). His attorney, Paul Roelofse, immediately brought an application for leave to appeal the sentence. The application was granted and Bailey was released on bail in the interim. In handing down the sentence earlier, Magistrate Johan Herselman said he had to overcome certain battles within himself after he, too, had to view the graphic images, some of children so young, their umbilical cords were still attached. Bailey and his 23-year-old female friend were arrested in March 2015 after police uncovered two hard drives containing 560 sexually explicit images and 401 videos containing child pornography at Bailey s Westering family home. He pleaded guilty in September last year to the possession and distribution thereof. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
