Thami Shobede Idols SA runner-up Thami Shobede will be belting out love songs at the Boardwalk amphitheatre next month at a concert presented by Khoi Culture. Shobede won the hearts of many fans of Idols SA with his smooth vocals. With his concert on April 8 to signal his first visit to Port Elizabeth, Shobede said audiences could expect to feel every emotion a good song provided. People who know me know I m old school and I ll be bringing James Brown s funk to the stage, supported by a lovely band, Shobede said. With his debut album expected to be released in April, Shobede said he would perform the track, Sthandwa, which was released during the competition. Also included will be other songs he performed while on the show. Since losing out to Noma Khumalo in the series, Shobede said his life after Idols SA had been blessed . The rising young star is now also signed to the same recording label as Khumalo. Sharing the stage alongside Shobede will be Terra Cox, who is no stranger to Port Elizabeth, and Uitenhage s very own Courtney Courus-Williams. 7de Laan actor Christo Davids, who plays Errol in the popular soapie, will be the host. San Entertainment owner and organiser of the event, Rochey Walters, said one of the main objectives when selecting the line-up was also to give local artists a chance to showcase their talent. This was why Courus-Williams along with Humansdorp s Diego Lottering were chosen as opening acts for the show. Thami is very motivational because he made it on to one of the previous seasons of Idols, but didn t make it to the top 10. Last season he made it all the way but unfortunately didn t win, Walters said. Tickets are available at Computicket for R100 per person and R200 for VIP. Doors will open from 6pm.
