Zimbabwe&#8217;s President Robert Mugabe Picture: PHILIMON BULAWAYO REUTERS Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe, who celebrated his 93rd birthday last week, flew to Singapore yesterday for a scheduled medical review. Mugabe appeared frail at his birthday party on Saturday, when he stood for more than an hour to deliver his speech. He paused for lengthy periods and mumbled at times. The president left for Singapore for a scheduled medical review, his press secretary, George Charamba, said. We expect him back in the country early next week. Mugabe has held power since 1980 during a reign marked by repression of dissent, vote-rigging and a sharp economic decline for the country. He recently spent several weeks in Asia on his annual holiday, returning in late January, though it has not officially been confirmed that he had medical treatment during the trip. He has made regular trips to Singapore for medical check-ups, and his health is the frequent subject of speculation. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
