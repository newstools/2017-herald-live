Daniel Emslie. Picture: Mark West The first event in the four-part Billabong Junior Series took place at Pollok Beach on Saturday and Lochness yesterday. The opening day of the tournament saw brilliant waves at the Pipe with the best junior surfers in the country reveling in the pristine offshore conditions. The waves are perfect out there, talented Nelson Mandela Bay surfer Dillon Hendricks said. The surfers climbed in as the event organisers set down a full day s surfing. The forecast looked smaller for the rest of the weekend, so it was decided to make the most of the excellent conditions. Standouts included Hendricks, Eli Beukes and Luke Slijpen, from Cape Town, Kayla Nogueira, from Durban, and Angelo Faulkner, from Jeffreys Bay. Yesterday, the swell was down somewhat, as forecast. After surfing a few early morning heats at small Pollok Beach, the event went mobile for the afternoon and relocated at Lochness on the wildside. The waves were bigger and highly contestable, bringing an exciting conclusion to the event. Lisa van Heerden, from J-Bay, placed second in the U12 girls final, and third in the U14 girls final. We re really happy with the outcome of our first junior event in Port Elizabeth, Billabong SA marketing manager Chad D Arcy said.
