The provincial Department of Health has allocated more than R14-billion over the next three years to recruit doctors, nurses and general staff, particularly for rural clinics and hospitals. Provincial health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said there had been much concern over the department s limited workforce and the pressure this placed on what staff there were at the province s clinics and hospitals. We want to improve healthcare in the province and, as such, 60% of the budget is going towards hiring clinical staff, Kupelo said. These are staff members the department cannot operate fully without, namely doctors, nurses and ambulance practitioners. Kupelo said the department had to deal with severe staff shortages, resulting in complaints from the public. With the new developments, Kupelo said the department was ready to implement the new organogram aimed at accelerating the provision of quality healthcare in the province. He said the recruitment drive would include general workers such as laundry workers, mortuary attendants and administrative clerks. We also want to address the issue of the nurse-patient ratio, Kupelo said. That will ensure that operations at all our health centres are up to standard. Money will also be spent on staff including drivers, cleaners, porters and operational managers. Kupelo said the department planned to implement the new structure at the beginning of next month after consultation with internal stakeholders. He said a complete revamp of the department could be expected over the next three years. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
