Highly trained animals placed on reserves in Eastern Cape Nine specialised anti-rhino poaching dogs have been deployed across the Eastern Cape, with three more expected to join their ranks soon. By April 12, the highly trained dogs, consisting of various breeds including Malinois, bloodhounds, German and Belgian Shepherds, will have been deployed to various game reserves across the province. The nine dogs already deployed are on reserves stretching from East London to Grahamstown and Cradock. Last year, 1 054 rhinos were killed in South Africa, compared with 1 175 in 2015 marking a small decline in poaching. A record 19 rhinos were killed in the Eastern Cape last year. There have been no poaching incidents in the province this year. K-9 Detection and Protection Services owner and trainer Aidon Lippstreu said the dogs were an asset in the war against poaching. Each dog undergoes several months of training to track poachers hiding on reserves. The dogs are deployed on both state-owned and private reserves. For security reasons, The Herald has agreed not to name the reserves. Lippstreu said the training of each dog costs an estimated R100 000. The training cost varies based on what the dog needs to be trained to do, he said. The training is rigorous and the dogs need to be desensitised to the smells of other game and animals commonly found on farms.
