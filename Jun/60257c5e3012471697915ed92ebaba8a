Police have arrested what they call &#8220;Walmer s most wanted&#8221; suspect following a joint operation during the early hours of this morning. In a joint operation between members of the Bethelsdorp Crime Prevention Unit, Visible Gang Intervention Team, and Tactical Response Team, three suspects were arrested at a house in Booysen Park, Bethelsdorp. Luthando Mtati (25), his girlfriend (21) and one other suspect (22) are detained for further investigation. Mtati, alias LIBO, was first arrested in December last year after he and two other suspects allegedly robbed a man at the Arlington tip in Victoria Drive ,Walmer. Mtati was granted bail in January this year but in March he failed to comply with his bail conditions. A warrant for his arrest was issued. At this stage investigators in Bethelsdorp and Walmer are probing possible links to other cases where Mtati and the other suspects may be implicated. According to police, two firearms (both stolen in Walmer in April 2017) and other suspected stolen property were seized during the operation in Booysen Park last night. Property included TVs, cellphones, brand name takkies, surround sound speakers, amplifiers, remote controls, bedding, jewellery, a bullet proof vest and perfumes. The Cluster Commander for Mount Road Cluster, Brigadier Keith Meyer has applauded the team involved in effecting the arrests. Our men and women in blue are relentless in the fight against crime, and we will not rest until those perpetrators who continue to instil fear and deprive our communities of their possessions are safely behind bars, Meyer said. Communities are urged to report any suspicious activities to the police as it is only if and when the police and the community work together that crime can successfully be curbed, he added. &nbsp; Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
