Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University will be known as Nelson Mandela University from July 20 File picture: www.nmmu.ac.za To commemorate what would have been former president Nelson Mandela s 99th birthday on July 18, Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University has announced that it is dropping the metropolitan part of its name. The institution said yesterday it would be relaunching itself as Nelson Mandela University on July 20 just over a year after the name change was gazetted by Higher Education and Training Minister Blade Nzimande. The university elected not to immediately formally use the new name as it believed adequate preparations were necessary to ensure that in using the name of Nelson Mandela, the former president is honoured respectfully and appropriately in ways befitting his stature, university spokeswoman Zandile Mbabela said. Sufficient progress to this effect, including changing the university logos and colours, has been realised. The university is thus pleased to share that the name Nelson Mandela University will be officially used from the second semester of this year. She said a celebratory event was planned for July 20 and would take place at the Missionvale campus. Mbabela said the name change came at a significant time and offered the opportunity to rebrand and position the institution continentally and globally, as well as usher in a new era of renewed vigour towards transformation.
