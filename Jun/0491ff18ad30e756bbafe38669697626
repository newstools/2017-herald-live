S School buildings at Woodridge College in Nelson Mandela Bay were engulfed in flames this afternoon (10/06/17) following a long battle by emergency services to keep the flames at bay. This is according to Woodridge director of marketing, Anthony de Villiers. He said due to the fire around the Woodridge campus, all students and residence staff were evacuated earlier today from the campus and are all safe. S &#8220;The fire fighters were able to keep the fire at bay for a long time but when the wind changed direction the fire department called for all volunteers to move away. They are controlling the situation as best they can,&#8221; he said. Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said the Woodridge College reception and music halls are on fire. The massive fire at Van Stadens prompted emergency services to close the N2 early on Saturday morning due to poor visibility caused by smoke. By 10:30am the road had been reopened while fire fighters and emergency services continued to battle the blaze but it was again closed by late afternoon. Motorists are advised to use alternative routes as it is not safe to drive through the Van Stadens area. Due to the fire, electricity supply has been cut in many areas of Nelson Mandela Bay. Areas that are off include Chatty, Kwanobuhle, Winterhoek Park, Thornhill, Gamtoos, Loerie, Driftsands, Lovemore Park, section of Despatch and parts of Walmer. &nbsp; JUST IN: The fire at the Van Stadens Gorge area has reached Woodridge College and Preparatory School.
