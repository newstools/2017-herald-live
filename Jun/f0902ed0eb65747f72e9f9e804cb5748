The comedian said he started the fast for his own spiritual reasons and through a series of Instagram videos opened up about his battles with it. He said the hardest part was adapting to a life without swearing and sex. The hardest part of fasting is the no sex no swearing and to try have pure thoughts because you know that I love an F-word Siv said. He said it was an uphill battle to keep his thoughts clean. I had quite a hard week and if I wasn t fasting I would have had many f-bombs to throw and this would have been a Siv rant he said.
