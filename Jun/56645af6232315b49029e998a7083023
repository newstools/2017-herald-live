The car that came crashing through a Mdantsane family s wall, damaging a tree and missing the house by centimetres, is being kept there until the wall is repaired Picture: SIBONGILE NGALWA A Mdantsane Eastern Cape family had a rude awakening on the weekend when a car literally crashed on their doorstep just missing a room where two children lay sleeping. The shaken family has now decided to impound the car that flew through their boundary wall in the early hours of Sunday taking half of the wall with it. The clock had just struck midnight when the Mgole family in NU3 were woken up by a loud bang startling the two children awake. We heard a loud crash just after midnight and the kids said there was a vehicle inside our yard but I kept insisting that it was a car on the street. When we looked through the window we found that a car had flown through our wall and was leaning against the window burglar bars Lindiwe Mgole 64 told the Daily Dispatch on Thursday. Mgole said when they went outside neighbours had filled their yard to witness the bizarre sight of the Kia vehicle surrounded by destroyed concrete slabs and part of a huge tree inside their yard as well as the damage to parts of their house. &#8211;DispatchLIVE Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
