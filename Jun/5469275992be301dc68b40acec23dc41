The All African Wildlife Express by Rosamund Haden, illustrated by Tony Pinchuck, published by Tafelberg, R190. It was truly challenging to hand over Rosamund Haden and Tony Pinchuck s The All African Wildlife Express to my kids, I so wanted to protect the beautifully illustrated book from sticky little hands and snotty noses. The colourfully illustrated pages makes it the coffee table book of children s stories too delightful to stack away in a bookshelf somewhere. After all, Pinchuck is an established designer, illustrator and artist. The reader can join Mr Elephant and all the other magnificent creatures from the Animal Kingdom for a roaring train ride and a fun-tastic party-playdate with the monkeys at the Hotel Splendide. Learn the name of various animals as you re taken on a wildlife journey of mammoth proportions. There s a slight hint of Wes Anderson in the drawings, something many a parent can appreciate. The storyline is humble but combined with a visual bouquet of drawings, it has the potential to take those big imaginations, which are captured in little bodies, along for the journey. But don t take my words for it, they are after all just a grown-up s way of expression. The real verdict? A wild train voyage to hang on to , I realise as I watch my three-year-old cuddle the book in bed while he drifts asleep. The pages are filled with a grand adventure for young and old!
