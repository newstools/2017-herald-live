Cassper Nyovest Picture: Mdu Ndzingi Cassper Nyovest will sit down with US hip-hop radio jock Charlamagne tha God for the first time since the radio personality accused Cassper of stealing Kanye West s floating stage design. Charlamagne got Cassper fans hot under the collar late last year when he referred to Cassper as some artist in Africa during a discussion about musicians stealing Kanye West s idea. The pair are set to meet when Charlamagne hosts Cassper on his breakfast show in August. The meeting was confirmed during a Twitter exchange between the two on Tuesday evening. .@cthagod I&#8217;m in New York in August my king.
