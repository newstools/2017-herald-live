The South African cricket team will amp up their test match preparation with a three-day warm-up against the England Lions at New Road in Worcester, starting today. Dean Elgar will captain the side in the absence of Faf du Plessis, who is awaiting the birth of his first child. This is the only match opportunity for the squad ahead of the first test match against England starting at Lord s in London on Thursday next week. The majority of the squad have been in action with either the limited overs squads or South Africa A, which opens up the opportunity to build a competitive edge against quality opposition. We have to compete, Elgar said yesterday. We have to compete against a very good England Lions side. To get that competitive edge will be a big thing for us. He said the opportunity to possibly captain the team was a dream come true as he continues to establish himself as one of the senior leaders in the test squad. I m very excited, Elgar said of the captaincy. It has been a dream of mine since I was a young boy and even if it doesn t happen at Lord s, it s still a great opportunity for me to be a senior leader within the group. The Proteas have won their last four series and will approach the next few weeks with a positive attitude despite the disappointing performances in the limited overs formats. After their recent efforts, Elgar said it was a good time for reflection. There is a different energy within the test side irrespective of how things have gone in the past. The energy is always in a good place for test cricket which is what I want for the boys. Meanwhile, South Africa and New Zealand were left frustrated after persistent rain and a wet outfield at Derby washed out their women s World Cup game yesterday. The 11.30am start for the group game was delayed and, with no respite from the weather, play was abandoned without a ball bowled at 3.15pm.
