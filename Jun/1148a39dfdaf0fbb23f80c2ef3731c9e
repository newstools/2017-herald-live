The Herald and Weekend Post are commended for their comprehensive coverage of the horrendous and devastating fires in Knysna, Plettenberg Bay and Van Stadens. First came reports of the outbreak of the fires, the speed at which they spread, then an indication of the damage caused, followed by an in-depth report on the loss of life, injuries, extensive loss of and damage to property. You dispatched your reporters to the affected areas and they reported in detail on the extent of the tragic situation, with many photographs. Soon followed heartwarming reports of the kindness and generosity of individuals and companies around South Africa. There were many acts of bravery for which the country is greatly indebted. Thanks to all who helped and continue to do so. Well done. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
