Two people have been killed in the latest spate of gang shootings in Port Elizabeth s northern areas. In the latest incident at 1.30pm yesterday, a 28-year-old man, believed to be affiliated to the Dustlife gang, was shot dead in Beetlestone Road in Gelvandale. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said the man, whose name is being withheld until his family has been informed, was gunned down while walking in the street. According to information, the victim was approached by three men, who shot at him. The suspects got into a taxi and drove off, she said. In a separate incident, taxi driver Ralph Vorster, 35, was shot dead in his taxi in Barberry Drive in Bethelsdorp shortly before 4pm on Monday. His body was found metres from his taxi. Naidu said it appeared that one of the passengers, a known gang member, had shot Vorster shortly after being picked up. It is believed Vorster was driving with his assistant in the vehicle when the taxi stopped in Barberry Drive to pick up two commuters. As they were driving, a passenger, who was known to them, produced a firearm, Naidu said. The assistant was ordered out of the taxi. Shots were fired at the driver, who succumbed to his injuries. The Provincial Gang Investigation Unit is investigating both murders, which police suspect are linked to gang rivalries. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
