Trevor Noah Picture: Trevor Noah/ Facebook Comedian and TV host Trevor Noah has reflected on the rage he felt after learning that his stepfather had shot his mother in the head. The incident, which took place several years ago has been well documented but Noah has often been shy to speak about the incident. However during an interview with People magazine US recently he opened up about the incident and the rage he felt over it. I remember after the shooting my mother was in hospital and all I felt was rage Noah said. He said his mother tried to calm him down by telling him not to harbour anger towards his stepfather. My mother said to me: Don t hate him for doing this but rather pity him because he too is a victim in his own way of a world that has thrust upon him an idea of masculinity that he has subscribed to and is now a part of. As for myself I do not wish to imbue myself with a hatred that only I will carry he said. Noah said his mother s attitude towards the incident inspired him. I think watching my mom her growth post-shooting our family and the way we became stronger really became the example I chose to live by. That s really what I ve stuck to and that s how I try to live my life every day. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
