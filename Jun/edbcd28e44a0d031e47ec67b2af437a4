World No 2 Djokovic slumped to a stunning 7-6 (7/5) 6-3 6-0 quarterfinal loss to Dominic Thiem for his earliest exit in Paris in seven years. Nadal, chasing a 10th Roland Garros title, will face 23-year-old Thiem after making the last four without breaking sweat. He was 6-2 2-0 up on Pablo Carreno Busta when his Spanish compatriot quit with an abdominal injury. Tomorrow s other semifinal will pitch world No 1 Murray, the runner-up to Djokovic last year, against 2015 champion Stan Wawrinka. Murray made the semifinals for the fifth time with a 2-6 6-1 7-6 (7/0) 6-1 win over Japanese eighth seed Kei Nishikori. Wawrinka became the oldest French Open semifinalist in 32 years when he brushed aside Marin Cilic 6-3 6-3 6-1. Simona Halep produced an incredible escape act to reach the semifinals, while Karolina Pliskova ended the run of the lone remaining home hope, Caroline Garcia. Romanian third seed Halep saved a match point as she trailed Elina Svitolina 6-3 5-1, before launching a sensational comeback to stun the Ukrainian in three sets. Pliskova, 25, will replace Angelique Kerber as the new world No 1 if she makes the final, while Halep would rise to the top of the rankings should she claim the title in Paris. The Czech edged a marathon 77-minute first set against 28th seed Garcia in a tie-break, having failed to convert an earlier set point at 5-3. The 25-year-old then broke the Frenchwoman as she served to stay in the match to clinch just her second appearance in the last four at a grand slam. I am very happy. Before the tournament I wasn t sure if I could play good tennis on clay, Pliskova said. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
