FIERY END: One of the trucks gutted by angry protesters Picture: Supplied Four trucks were set alight yesterday when angry residents in Motherwell protested against being forcefully removed by the municipality. More than 100 residents who had illegally occupied land in Motherwell NU29 and NU30 took to the streets to protest against the removals. Human settlements head Nqaba Bhanga said the demolition of more than 300 structures was a success. We want to make it clear that no one was staying in NU29 where demolitions were taking place, he said. We have demolished frames that were standing on their own. Bhanga said the frames were structures that people had put up with the intention of building shacks in the area later and the hope of eventually getting RDP houses. Two hundred frames were demolished in Kamvelihle, while 100 frames and one shack were demolished in NU29. Of the four trucks, two were owned by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality while the other two were privately owned. Bhanga could not confirm where the trucks were headed when they were set alight. We encourage the law to take its course against people who are burning state property and cars of private citizens, he said. More evictions are scheduled to take place in Wells Estate and Ramaphosa today Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
