Members of the Western Cape cabinet are meeting in Knysna today, a week since the devastating fire that destroyed at least 600 properties. Also attending the meeting, after which it is expected an announcement will be made, are Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen and Environmental Affairs Minister Edna Molewa. Officials would not say what that announcement would be. On Tuesday, Knysna mayor Eleanore Bouw-Spies told residents at a series of meetings to update them on the situation that the municipality had applied for Knysna to be declared a disaster area. Residents biggest gripe is the lack of electricity and water. But Bouw-Spies promised them they would have timelines soon as to when they could expect municipal services up and running in different suburbs. We are struggling to restore the damage to the infrastructure, she said. The cabinet members and municipal officials are expected to do a site visit after the cabinet meeting.
