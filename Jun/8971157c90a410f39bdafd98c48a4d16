Advocate Terry Price and murder accused Christopher Panayiotou File picture: Eugene Coetzee Picture: Eugene Coetzee Lawyers representing Christopher Panayiotou now want the presiding judge to recuse himself, based on their belief that the murder accused has not been granted a fair trial. This comes after Judge Dayalin Chetty found a secret video recording in which Panayiotou allegedly implicated himself in his wife&#8217;s murder, to be admissible. Advocate Terry Price SC was upset that Judge Chetty did not give reasons for his ruling. The trial has accordingly been postponed to Wednesday. &nbsp; Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
