The prospects of reviving a power-sharing government in Northern Ireland, a cornerstone of its peace process, appeared bleak yesterday, with parties still bickering in the last full day of talks. After three months of squabbling, negotiations were set to go down to the wire. If they cannot agree to form a semi-autonomous government in Belfast by 4pm today, then the province will instead be fully governed from London. The power-sharing executive at Stormont is the cornerstone of a peace process that ended three decades of violent conflict in the province. A collapse of trust led to a March 2 snap election to the assembly, which has powers over matters such as health, education, justice and the province s economy. The conservative Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) finished narrowly ahead of Irish socialists Sinn Fein. DUP negotiator Edwin Poots indicated talks were not running smoothly. I can t say they are easy but, nonetheless, we want to get Stormont up and running, he said. Sinn Fein accused the DUP of refusing to budge on any of their demands. The DUP have not moved on any of the substantive issues which sit at the heart of this crisis, party chairman Declan Kearney said. In London, British Prime Minister Theresa May s party struck a deal with the DUP on Monday that will afford her Conservatives a slim parliamentary majority.
