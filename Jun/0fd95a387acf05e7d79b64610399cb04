Nelson Mandela Bay is currently experiencing extremely low levels in the bulk water storage reservoirs on the western side of the Metro, the municipality said on Tuesday. The low levels are due to the fires that occurred between Van Stadens and Loerie, which have damaged the electrical supply to the Loerie Water Treatment Works and various pump stations in the area. This has resulted in a complete loss of water supply from the Loerie system as well as an inability to transfer water from other systems due to large pump stations being down. According to the municipality, indications are that electrical supply will be re-established by Wednesday night. Currently, the critical reservoir levels are at 0% for Summit, 14% for Chelsea and 9% for the KwaNobuhle Bulk Reservoir. As a result, the Mandela Metro is currently running out of water at a number of its reservoirs and the following areas will be affected first : Rowallan Park, Kabega, Westering, Cotswold, Sunridge Park, Framesby, Fernglen, Linton Grange, Gelvandale, Baywest area, KwaNobuhle, Reservoir Hills, Khayamnandi, Van Stadens Gorge area as well as all consumers connected to the Loerie &#8211; Summit &#8211; Chelsea Bulk Supply Pipelines. Residents and businesses in these areas could already be experiencing low water pressure and discoloured water as a result of the critically low levels in the supplying reservoirs. If this situation does not improve, more areas will be affected by water disruptions and lower water pressure, said municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki The Municipality strongly appeals to residents and businesses to use water for essential purposes only and strongly advises against the filling of tanks as this will increase the demand and lower the supply. &nbsp; Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
