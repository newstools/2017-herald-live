Police spokesman Captain Johannes Ramphora said David Ngwenya was denied bail and his case postponed to June 23 for further investigation. We are still investigating the case and we are looking for more suspects as we believe he was not alone in the commission of the crime Ramphora said. Mboneni Yende who speaks on behalf of Thembisile s family said they were only informed on Monday about the man&#8217;s arrest. We understand that this man was arrested on Thursday but we as the family were only told by the police today [Monday]. We are still to confirm the man s identity and occupation with the police. Mboneni however said the family was pleased that someone had been arrested in connection with Thembisile s murder. We are happy that something is happening because there are a lot of cases that end up being cold cases. This shows that when we unite not only as a family but as a community things happen. We are also grateful to Eskom as they also played a big role in making sure the perpetrator is brought to book Mboneni said. Thembisile, 30, was found dead in her office at an Eskom substation in Springs 13 days after she had gone missing. She had been working at Eskom as a trainee technician. She joined the power utility in 2015. &#8211; TimesLIVE Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
