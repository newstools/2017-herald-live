Beyonce and husband Jay Z have welcomed twins according to media reports Picture: Instagram Pop diva Beyonce and her rap mogul husband Jay Z (real name Shawn Carter) have welcomed twins, according to US media reports on the two new members of music s royal family that already includes five-year-old Blue Ivy. News that the songstress had given birth, reported by entertainment outlets including People magazine and US Weekly, ignited social media, with the so-called Bey hive fan group buzzing over the yet unrevealed sexes and names of the latest additions to the Carter clan. US Weekly cited multiple unidentified sources as saying that the twins were born last week. Entertainment news outlet E!, also citing unidentified sources, said the couple had been spotted at a Los Angeles area hospital on Thursday. Speculation grew when an unidentified woman was photographed on Friday carrying a large bouquet of pink, blue and purple flowers &#8212; complete with a card that appeared to read B + J &#8212; along with twin pink and blue balloons in the shape of feet that read Baby Girl and Baby Boy . A representative for Beyonce did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Superstar Beyonce in February made the blockbuster revelation that she was expecting. Clad in panties and a bra under a flowing veil, she commanded control of the internet by posting a picture of herself kneeling beside a huge floral arrangement, her hands cradling her rounded belly. We would like to share our love and happiness. We have been blessed two times over, the 35-year-old singer wrote. We are incredibly grateful that our family will be growing by two, and we thank you for all your well wishes. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
