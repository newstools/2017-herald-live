Picture: Ivor Markman PE City Football Club will celebrate on Saturday the 50th anniversary of them winning the National Football League in 1967. PE City were a force to be reckoned with nationally in the 1960s, drawing crowds of thousands to St George s Park on Friday nights. After their promotion to the NFL in 1964, they received a boost from the Ford Motor Company that saw them import a range of international players to bolster their squad. They went on to become the first South African team to employ footballers as full-time professional players and rose from 13th position in 1964 to bringing home the trophy in 1967. The team will be sharing their memories with fans and former players on Saturday. Photographs of the NFL matches as well as the original 1967 trophy will be displayed. A short soccer match between the legends and current players will also be a highlight of the day. Organiser Eddie Falconer said: Not many teams were able to say they won the NFL. We are proud to share this with locals who supported us and to pay tribute to the legendary players who played for and against PE City. Having a moment to share memorabilia and reflect with the young players about where we have come from as a team will be the highlight of the day for us. PE City legend and former goalkeeper Iain Ower, who played in the championship-winning side, said: Playing football back then was blissful. The Fridays where thousands of people would fill up the venue were comforting and made us really enjoy football. Seeing my former teammates and reminiscing about the good times we had in the club will be really nice. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
