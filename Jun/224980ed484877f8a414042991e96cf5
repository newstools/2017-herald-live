30/06/2017. ANC President Jacob Zuma greets delegates before the start of the ANC Policy conference taking place at Nasrec. Picture: Masi Losi/Sunday Times Discussions on the economy at the ANC&#8217;s national policy conference have to be centered around how to reignite growth President Jacob Zuma said during his opening address on Friday. This comes as the country has entered a technical recession. &#8220;At the time of the budget in February the economy was expected to grow at a low 1.3% in 2017. Given the current difficulties even this low growth rate may not be achieved &#8221; Zuma said. However he said the policy conference was also taking place against the background of &#8220;good progress&#8221; that has been made in the country in the past 23 years. Zuma sent the markets into a tail spin earlier this year when he removed Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas during a late-night Cabinet reshuffle. He replaced Gordhan with Malusi Gigaba. Shortly after this some rating agencies downgraded the country&#8217;s sovereign credit rating to junk status. This was blamed on the reshuffle and political uncertainty. The ANC is heading to its elective conference in December where it will elect Zuma&#8217;s successor. Zuma started his address on Friday talking about unity in the ANC. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
