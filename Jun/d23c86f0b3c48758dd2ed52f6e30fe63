Plettenberg Bay volunteer firefighter Bradley Richards died after he sustained burns to 70% of his body while combating raging fires along the Garden Route. Picture: Firstcare Wildfire Support on Facebook. &nbsp; Clinging onto her daughter, the mother of hero firefighter Bradley Richards sobbed as speaker upon speaker recalled his generous nature, his sense of humour and his loyalty. Also attended by president Jacob Zuma, the memorial service at Plettenberg Bay community Church was lined with row upon row of fire firefighters, some wiping away tears. So full was the church that some mourners congregated in the entrance outside the hall. Zuma, who received a lukewarm reception from those attending, was overshadowed by the firefighters. Pastor Johan Coetzee asked all firefighters in the hall to stand which led to a standing ovation from hundreds of family and friends. Richards, 24, died last week while fighting raging fires in Knysna. &nbsp; Bradley Richards&#8217; sister&#8217;s letter is being read. She describes a wonderful, generous man. &#8220;RIP my little brother.&#8221; #KnysnaFire #PlettFire HeraldLIVE (@HeraldPE) June 15, 2017 Guard of honour formed outside Brad Richards&#39; memorial.
