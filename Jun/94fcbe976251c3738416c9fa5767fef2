A man pointed a firearm at the Red Location Development Committee secretary this week, threatening to kill her if she did not stop what she was doing. Noluthando Rusi, 45, said the incident on Wednesday in New Brighton also saw the gunman fire a shot into the air and then two into the ground. Rusi said the only dispute the committee had was with the construction of a road near the Red Location Museum in Ward 15. The project is being managed by Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality. Protests have prevented further construction of the road. Rusi said the gunman, who was wearing a balaclava, approached her in Olaf Palme Street. He told me, stop what you doing otherwise you will die . He then cocked his firearm, she said. The man fired off three shots. He then walked away. I was shaken and I no longer feel safe, Rusi said. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge confirmed the incident. He said the complaint was laid by a 45year-old woman who alleged a firearm had been pointed at her. The alleged incident relates to a protest in the area, he said. Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said the purpose of the project was to uplift and benefit the community.
