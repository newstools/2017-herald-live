The National Sea Rescue Institute has warned of big sea swells of up to 10 to 12 metres in places along the Western and Eastern Cape coastline due to a cold front expected to sweep over the southern parts of the country midweek. Officially the SA Weather Service predicts wave heights to reach 9 to 12 metres in places around Wednesday. Gale Force winds are also predicted during this coming week the NSRI said. This cold front bringing heavy rough sea swells and gale force winds would be further affected by the approaching full moon Spring tide which would peak on Friday at full moon it added. NSRI are urging boaters paddlers surfers shore-line anglers the fishing community and bathers to be cautious around the coastline in light of these big sea swells expected with the cold front that will also be affected by the full moon Spring tide. The full moon Spring tide brings higher than normal high tides lower than normal low tides and stronger than normal rip currents. Very strong rip currents are expected along with the predicted rough sea conditions. NSRI urge the public to follow official weather authorities predictions and weather warnings and prepare for the expected conditions predicted and to be cautious around the coastline said NSRI spokesman Craig Lambinon.
