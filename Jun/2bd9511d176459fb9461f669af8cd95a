Christopher Panayiotou talks to defence advocate Terry Price and attorney Alwyn Griebenow File picture: Eugene Coetzee The case against murder accused Christopher Panayiotou continues in the Port Elizabeth High Court today, where Advocate Terry Price SC will continue shock bid to get the presiding judge to recuse himself. On Monday, an incriminating video recording of Panayiotou was ruled admissible but Price said he felt like he was litigating in the dark after Judge Dayalin Chetty did not give immediate reasons for his decision to allow the sting video into evidence. Chetty found the secret recording in which Panayiotou, 30, chats to self-confessed middleman Luthando Siyoni shortly after the murder of Panayiotou s wife Jayde to be admissible following a lengthy trial-within-a-trial. He said he would give the reasons for his ruling in conjunction with his main judgment at the end of the trial. Follow us on Twitter for live updates from within the courtroom today.
