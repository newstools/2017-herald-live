 They don t call it the Friendly City for no reason says Jan Jordaan following his recent visit to Port Elizabeth. Enjoying Saturday s warm weather, Jordaan was able to capture drone footage of a school of dolphins swimming close to the habour wall near Kings Beach. It was quite tricky to film this as I have no idea when a wave might surprise the drone from the side. It was the most beautiful day along the sea shore in PE, it s nice not being able to realize it&#8217;s mid-winter in South Africa with a summary day like this one, Jordaan said.
