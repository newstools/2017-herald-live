DA leader Mmusi Maimane has challenged President Jacob Zuma to sue the Sunday Times if a report in the newspaper at the weekend about the Guptas buying a R330-million mansion for him in Dubai is false. Noting that the Presidency had wasted no time in calling the claim &#8220;a fabrication&#8221;, Maimane said the claims made in the article were not trivial and went to the very nub of state capture by &#8220;the notorious&#8221; Guptas. &#8220;The allegations are serious, and cannot simply be dismissed in a press release. &#8220;If the story is false &#8211; as the Presidency claims &#8211; the DA challenges the president to take legal action against the newspaper for publishing false and defamatory information about him and his good friends, the Gupta brothers,&#8221; Maimane said. &#8220;If Jacob Zuma has nothing to hide, then he must proceed with legal action in this matter. &#8220;That way, evidence can be brought from either side, and the people of South Africa will be afforded the truth in this matter. &#8220;If the president fails to do so, we can only assume the content of the story to be true &#8211; and that his ANC has sold this country to the Gupta family for profit.&#8221; Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
