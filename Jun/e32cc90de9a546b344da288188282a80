Umhlobo Wenene FM breakfast show co-host Mafa Bavuma was the MC at the Imilonji Star Search Since it was Youth Day last Friday, I was keen to check out some of the activities supposedly being organised in the name of youth, which for some is 90% of the time about going out, drinking and acting stupid. Skinnerbek headed to the UBH at KwaZakhele Epakeni for the first time last Friday. I just wanted to experience the unplugged backyard hangout that people are always talking about and I thought since it s Youth Day, why not? The event was expected to start at 6pm as it was written on the poster but at that time the organisers were still setting up the stage and sound. Your gossip gal waited patiently in the car, doing a bit of people watching at the same time. But after an hour of sitting and nothing happening, I moved my cute behind out of that lot and headed home. As I made my way out of the gate I spotted some people asking the guards at the gate for their refunds. I believe the main act, Roots 2000, only got on stage at 2am. From the pictures on social media it looks like people had a good time though. I don t know what the turnout was like but if Asanda Mali was there, then it s all right by me. On Sunday I went to Dopparoz Lifestyle for the Imilonji Star Search. This event also started late and was not well attended, as some people objected to paying R30 entry at the door. Junk status is upon us and they had just spent money on Youth Day activities. Vocalist Nomabotwe made it to the next round of the competition but just imagine the embarrassment had she not. It is always lovely chatting to actress Nomhle Nkonyeni. I feel like I m in the presence of an oracle who will reveal the secrets of the universe to me. But fans, please do not get fresh with Nomhle, she is older now and does not always have the energy to socialise and take pictures. Until next time darlings, ciao for now!
