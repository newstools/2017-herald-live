A thick cloud of smoke was visible from Walmer on Friday afternoon (09/06/17) as firefighters battled yet another blaze in Nelson Mandela Bay, this time at Schoenmakerskop. The fire was raging on the Sacramento Trial near the village. Firefighters battled blazes behind the homes in Marine Drive and managed to contain the fires just before the boundaries of the homes. Last night, residents in Sardinia Bay and Schoenmakerskop had to be evacuated as a massive blaze that had destroyed a huge amount of vegetation threatened properties and livestock. Meanwhile the Port Elizabeth weather office warned on Facebook that strong North Westerly winds are expected over the Eastern Cape tomorrow (Saturday 10 June), making conditions favourable for the development of runaway fires. Earlier this week, EMS the fire brigade and volunteers battled a number of fires around Nelson Mandela Bay. Several houses between Thornhill, Lady Slipper and Rocklands on the outskirts of Port Elizabeth were gutted as a raging fire swept across the mountain range on Wednesday night.
