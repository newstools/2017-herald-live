Doorewaard, 26, and Schutte, 34, are accused of murdering 16-year-old Matlhomola Moshoeu on April 20. Violent protests broke out in the North West town of Coligny after the two were first released on bail. They said in an earlier court appearance that they had apprehended Moshoeu after seeing him steal sunflowers in a plantation. The two claim that they had put him on the back of a bakkie to take him to the nearest police station but that he then jumped off the moving bakkie. The state however alleges that they had pushed him off the bakkie. The Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) is yet to make a decision on where the case should be heard and it was postponed to August 7. The DPP also sent the docket back to the police for further investigation. BusinessLIVE Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
