Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa Picture: KEVIN SUTHERLAND South Africa and the ANC are not in a good place Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa has conceded. Ramaphosa who is in the running to be the ANC s next president in December was addressing the party s Western Cape provincial policy conference yesterday. The meeting by the ANC Western Cape members was to prepare for the party s national policy conference in Johannesburg later this month. The Western Cape conference was also attended by NEC members Pallo Jordan and Derek Hanekom. Ramaphosa who was warmly in Stellenbosch welcomed by delegates also had words for those in the party who were behaving badly , saying their actions did not just affect them and their families but the entire country. Where we are right now, our movement is not in a good place, he said. Our country is not in a good place. And now here is where the issue really is important as we sit here this mighty, glorious ANC it gives us the platform to voice our views on behalf of our people . . . to come up with proposals to see how we will get out of this situation that we are in. Without mentioning the Gupta family by name Ramaphosa said radical economic transformation should not benefit just a few families. We have a lot of resources. It is because you have the wrong people in a number of positions. Radical economic transformation should lead to inclusive growth and does not lead to the enrichment of just a few or certain families in South Africa.
