Two robberies in Nelson Mandela Bay, only four hours apart, are under investigation. In the latest robbery, a 36-yearold man was held hostage in his Burt Drive home in Cotswold at 1am yesterday. Police spokeswoman Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said two men had gained entry by forcing open a back door. The men came across the man sleeping on a couch, she said. They held him at gunpoint and tied his hands together with a cellphone charger cord. They then unplugged the television and the CCTV camera. While the house was being ransacked, the man s mother woke up and pressed a panic button. The men fled and jumped into a getaway car parked outside, Janse van Rensburg said. An Atlas security official chased their car, but lost it in Korsten. At 9pm on Tuesday night, four gunmen broke into a house in Khayamnandi, Despatch. Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said a manhunt was under way after the men allegedly confronted a family in their Matthew Goniwe Street home. The suspects took electrical appliances including a tablet, television and money before fleeing. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
