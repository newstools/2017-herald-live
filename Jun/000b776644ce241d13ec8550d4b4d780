HERE TO HELP: VWSA s Matt Gennrich hands over the keys to three VW vehicles to Herald editor Brett Horner Picture: EUGENE COETZEE The Herald is heading down the Garden Route this week to bring you the latest news on efforts to repair and rebuild Knysna, Plettenberg Bay and other areas ravaged by last week s devastating fires and Volkswagen South Africa (VWSA) is chipping in to help. VWSA has provided three vehicles two Amaroks and one California Beach camper van to ensure that the Herald can send relay teams of reporters and photographers along the Garden Route to visit these towns to bring you the news first. Herald editor Brett Horner said: Our focus in the weeks to come will turn to the rebuilding efforts in our fire-torn communities. Often, this aspect of disaster reporting is neglected. Thanks to the generous contribution from VWSA, we can now establish ourselves in these affected areas and provide more comprehensive reporting around the clock. Hopefully, this partnership will show how resilient the human spirit can be, something we can all take inspiration from in this time of despair. VWSA communications manager Matt Gennrich said it had received a call from the Herald, inquiring whether it would like to play a part in providing assistance and ensuring that reports were consistent and accurate. As VW we wanted to respond, so we looked within the organisation to see which vehicles we have that would be the most suitable and most useful in telling the story, he said. We decided to provide two Amaroks and one California camper bus. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
