Local municipalities in the Sarah Baartman district received a boost yesterday when fire equipment worth R1.3-million was donated to the region. The equipment includes fire hoses, torches, ropes, self-contained breathing apparatus, chainsaws, communication radios and structural fire-fighting protective clothing. The donation, announced at the Radisson Blu Hotel yesterday, was handed over by insurance firm Santam to the Sarah Baartman Municipality. The partnership between the two has been in place since 2015. Mayor Eunice Kekana appealed for more businesses to lend support during disasters. We are popular in agriculture. When fires like what happened on June 6 destroy the plantations, we know it will take about five years to regain what is lost, Kekana said. The Sarah Baartman Municipality is an institution of stability and we have a very solid administration. Santam social corporate investment manager Tersia Mdunge said the devastating fires in the Garden Route and surrounding areas had again highlighted the need for collaboration between organised business and provincial and district disaster management centres to enhance the capacity of local government in the areas of fire and flood risk management. Cooperative Governance MEC Fikile Xasa said the destruction caused had shown unity in the country in times of confusion. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
