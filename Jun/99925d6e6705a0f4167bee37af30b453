The father of the three-month-old baby girl who was allegedly snatched from her mother s arms on Sunday has pleaded with the public to come forward if they have any information which might lead to finding their daughter. The father, who did not want to give his name and who is referred to only as Tatu Nala, said the family was deeply hurt and saddened. It hurts being in this situation and I hope if anyone has information or knows of anything . . . I plead with them to come forward and go to the police, he said. She s still a baby and we re looking and waiting to see what the intentions of the abductors were in taking my baby. Does he want money, is he looking for revenge for reasons we don t know? Nala, a police officer stationed in Cradock, said he did not recall his family having bad blood with anyone who might want to get back at them by abducting their baby. The little girl was allegedly abducted at about 5.30pm in NU7, Motherwell, on Sunday when her mother accepted a lift from three men in a black BMW while she was waiting for a taxi. The concerned father said as young as his daughter was, she was able to tell her mother and father apart and would smile and laugh if someone played with her. Police spokesman Captain Andre Beetge said police were investigating the abduction. Beetge said the mother had accepted a lift in a car in which three men were travelling when she was allegedly sprayed with a substance that burnt her eyes. The car was stopped and she was forced out of the car, she said. When she came to the police station, whatever substance she was sprayed with was already gone, Beetge said. The baby girl was last seen wearing a pink beanie, pink top and navy blue tracksuit pants and was wrapped in a pink and blue blanket. Anyone with information, should contact investigating officer Captain Mthetheleni Ntshikose on 071-352-4475. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
