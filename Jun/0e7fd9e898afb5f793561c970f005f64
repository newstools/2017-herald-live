Picture: Joubert Loots The next Food Truck Friday is on June 16, and the Youth Day edition will be a family affair. The first daytime edition of the Baakens Food Truck Friday moves back outside onto the grass area at WERK_ in the Baakens Valley from 12 noon to 5pm. Entry is free. The food festival rounds up 20 food trucks, trailers and tuk-tuks along Lower Valley Road, offering a variety of authentic dishes. All food is priced under R45 and the street feast includes meals ranging from Belgian waffles, vegan eats and Asian food to hearty burgers, artisanal pizzas and pancakes. The afternoon market intends to have friends and family gather on the lawn with their picnic blankets and deck chairs, to enjoy live music and the array of eats on offer. Organisers Jan du Plessis of design and building collaborative, WERK_ and Grant Foong of Foong s Asian Street Food are trying to make this the essential monthly family event. The DJ truck has made way for a more chilled atmosphere and the event now features a 100% acoustic music lineup featuring the best in local and regional upcoming musicians. This month presents Eastern Cape artists Skank and the Roots, Jason Gladwin, Alex Cavan and Them &amp; Us. Kids of all ages are also catered for and can be entertained with pony and pedal go-kart rides, jumping castles, soft-play for toddlers and more. For the thirsty, bar facilities are available from Benn Koppen and the Richmond Hill Brewing Company. Technical support partners Gardmed Ambulance Services, DKZ Cleaning Services and Skip Solutions ensure that a high standard of cleanliness, safety and security are maintained.
