A 49-year-old woman has been arrested after reporting to police in Motherwell that her 3-month-old baby was abducted by three men in a black BMW in NU7, Motherwell on Sunday. After three days of intensive investigation by the specialist investigating officers of the Motherwell SAPS Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit (FCS Unit), a breakthrough was made by SAPS on Wednesday morning (14/06/17), after discovering that the case that was reported was false. The 22-year-old biological mother of the 3-month-old baby was identified and questioned. It was discovered that there existed a foster parent arrangement between the two women without following the legal prescribed routes. This arrangement turned sour and the false case was opened by the woman. The 49-year-old suspect was arrested and will be appearing before the Motherwell Magistrates Court on Thursday on a charge of Perjury. The Department of Social Work Services will also be tasked to intervene and deal with this matter. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
