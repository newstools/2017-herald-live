Catch South African pop singer Elvis Blue live in concert at the Boardwalk on Friday, June 16. The South African pop idol will perform live in a one night only show on Youth Day at 8pm. A capacity crowd is expected for the show, in which Elvis Blue will perform some of the hits that have made him a household name over the years. Tickets cost R130 per person and are available at TicketPro. Pre-booking is advised. Elvis Blue took part in and went on to win the 2010 M-Net SA Idols competition, sharing half the profit with runner-up Lloyd Cele. Since then, he has blazed a trail across the South African music industry, producing chart-topping songs like Things My Father Said, Lighthouse and Save Me, and performing to capacity crowds at music festivals and venues countrywide. With an average of 133 live performances a year, three platinum albums, one gold selling album and a long list of top 10 hits to his credit, Elvis Blue is reckoned to be one of the most successful artists in South Africa. He remains a rare breed in his ability to straddle both English and Afrikaans music genres with ease and relevance. With his unique blend of charisma and authenticity, his shows are known for not only the perfect blend of familiar favourites and new music, but also for his comical and often whimsical story telling that sweeps audiences along in a journey that is both personal and entertaining. He is the first Afrikaans artist to scale the Top Ten of the iTunes Store chart &#8212; and he cracked it on the very first day. Elvis s multiple SAMA (South African Music Award) nominations over the years also highlight his talent as one of the most talented songwriters and performers in South Africa.
