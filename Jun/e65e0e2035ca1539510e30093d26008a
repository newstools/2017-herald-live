A court interpreter has unwittingly landed himself in the dock after allegedly trying to bribe a home affairs immigration officer. McAnderson Doctor an interpreter at Kimberley s Galeshewe Court for the Department of Justice in the northern Cape is facing charges of corruption and defeating the ends of justice. He allegedly facilitated a bribery transaction between the immigration officer and an migrant who had been arrested for not having the necessary asylum documents. Hawks spokesman Captain Philani Nkwalase said a preliminary investigation had found that he tried to coerce the immigration officer in exchange for money not to produce a final rejection letter in court against the immigrant. The roles were reversed when he found himself earlier this week standing in the dock as an accused at the Kimberley Magistrate s Court. The case against McAnderson was postponed to 30 June 2017 for formal bail application and he remains in custody. More arrests on the matter are imminent said Nkwalase. A probe is also underway to determine his correct age because he was in possession of documents with conflicting dates of birth.
