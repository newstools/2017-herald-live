Mamelodi Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane Picture: Sydney Seshibedi / Gallo Images Mamelodi Sundowns will be hoping for better luck and a more disciplined defensive performance when they take on Tunisian side Esperance in the African Champions League tomorrow. Sundowns became the first South African side to play 100 African club competition matches when they were defeated 2-1 by Esperance at home on June 4. While the loss puts their quarterfinal participation in peril, it was still a major milestone for the Champions League holders who are ahead of Orlando Pirates (95 matches) as the South African club to have played in the most continental games. SuperSport United (59) are third on the list of most matches representing South Africa followed by Kaizer Chiefs (54). Sundowns coach Pitso Mosimane has said the pressure will be on Esperance to get a home win. The pressure is not on us Mosimane said. They are playing in front of their supporters they must show them how good they are. I expect them to play the same way they would like to dominate and I don t expect them to sit back. Sundowns have confirmed that Khama Billiat will miss the match through injury but the quartet of captain Hlompho Kekana Anthony Laffor Wayne Arendse and Motjeka Madisha are all available. Mosimane said his team were eyeing the quarterfinals and that they would not be too overawed by the quality of Esperance. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
