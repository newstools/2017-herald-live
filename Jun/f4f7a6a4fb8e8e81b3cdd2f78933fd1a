Elon Musk Picture: supplied A city on Mars with a million inhabitants could be achievable within 50 years, South African space entrepreneur Elon Musk has forecast, as he laid out plans to turn mankind into a multi-planetary species. The SpaceX founder warned that humans would need to venture away from Earth to avoid a Doomsday event and our eventual extinction . But he said that a huge Martian city could be established this century, which would not just be an outpost, but a fully functioning society with iron foundries and pizza joints . Musk is planning the first manned flight to Mars in 2023 and has said he wants to die on Mars, although he has stipulated not on impact . Under plans published in the journal New Space, the billionaire said he hoped to build a Mars Colonial Fleet of more than 1 000 cargo ships with 200 passengers each and materials to build homes, industrial plants and shops. He claimed that the first colonists could begin setting out in a decade, and said it would take between 40 and 100 years to populate a city. He said: One path is we stay on Earth forever, and then there will be some eventual extinction. The alternative is to become a space-faring civilisation and a multi-planetary species. Nasa has also said it is planning to establish a Mars colony by the 2030s, although it plans to establish a base on the Moon and other stepping stones first, and the Mars One project, set up by a nonprofit organisation based in the Netherlands, has proposed to establish a permanent human colony there by 2027.
