Three suspects accused of murdering 10-year-old Liyema Dutywa will spend another 10 days behind bars after their case was postponed in the Libode Magistrate&#8217;s Court in the Eastern Cape on Tuesday. Fuzile Hanise 30 Asanda Mbhele 23 and Manduleli Majova 27 made their second appearance after being arrested about two weeks ago. They face charges of kidnapping murder and possession of a firearm and ammunition. Dutywa&#8217;s body was found in a forest near Tsolo. Last week their case was postponed to allow them to arrange their own legal defence after they told Magistrate Vuyisile Yaliwe that they could afford to hire the services of private lawyers. Earlier on Tuesday their lawyer Lucky Mthambo asked the court to postpone the case to allow for enough time to consult. The case was postponed to June 29 for a formal bail application.
