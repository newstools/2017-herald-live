Minister of Social Development Bathabile Dlamini File picture: Ruvan Boshoff Social Development Minister Bathabile Dlamini will hear on Thursday whether she should be held personally responsible for the payment system crisis at the South African Social Security Agency (Sassa). If the Constitutional Court finds against her Dlamini will have to pay the costs of the matter brought by advocacy group Black Sash from her own pocket. Sassa CE Thokozani Magwaza and former social development director-general Zane Dangor have accused Dlamini of lying to the court when she said she did not know what had caused the grants payments fiasco. If the court finds Dlamini has lied in her affidavit she could be prosecuted. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
