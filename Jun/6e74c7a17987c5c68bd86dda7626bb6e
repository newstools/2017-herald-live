ANC caucus sources had told the Sunday Times two weeks ago the proposal had been tabled and supported by several MPs at a caucus meeting two weeks ago but that no formal decision had been reached. That meeting had been called and attended by members of the ANC top six leadership such as secretary-general Gwede Mantashe treasurer-general Zweli Mkhize and national chairperson Baleka Mbete. &#8220;In this meeting with the ANC leadership caucus was resolute that it (would) never vote for any motion proposed by the opposition that (sought) to remove the president of the republic who is also the president of the ANC &#8221; he said.
