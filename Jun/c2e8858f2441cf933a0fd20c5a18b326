Thandeka Rune, left, Lonwabo Klaas and Zimkhitha Galela tried out for the MTV Base VJ Search at the Neach Hotel Picture: Mark West Darlings, it has been a while since yours truly was last at Cubana at the beachfront. I gave it a crack last weekend for the MTV Base VJ Search after-party and, my oh my, my eyeballs are still stinging from all the shenanigans I saw. Young women were throwing themselves at loaded, older men who were happy to bask in the attention they received. No man, meisies, this is not on. Most of the girls were what you d call body goals they did look amazing. Top Billing presenter and Cooking with Lorna host Lorna Maseko was also there and looked pretty hot herself, but left before the crowds gathered in earnest. A highlight for me was seeing the sexy Prince Kaybee. Even though he has chopped off his locks, the brother still looks good and had us tearing up the dance floor. Could that have been Deputy Minister of Higher Education Mdu Manana popping bottles at one of the tables? The MTV Base VJ Search announced their top acts who will be competing in Johannesburg at the do. Your Skinnerbek relished her VIP status and soon she too was cracking open the bubbly and enjoying a couple of Breezers until it was Uber time. Safety first, ladies. At Bay Fashion Sunday, the new MC Toni Williams must have been freezing in her teeny-tiny silver number by Bay designer Cleo Allison. It was a beautiful outfit for summer, but a miniskirt and sleeveless crop top in June? Shem! On the whole, though, the fashion was great with four designers hoping their ranges would be picked for the second Nelson Mandela Bay Fashion Week in October. International knitwear designer Laduma Ngxokolo was another crowd-puller to the Roof Garden Bar event. Our local hero is branching out from his gorgeous but pricey garments and is now also designing bright and funky socks. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
