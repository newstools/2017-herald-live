Elvis Blue will be at the Boardwalk tomorrow Catch South African pop singer Elvis Blue live in concert at the Boardwalk tomorrow at 8pm. The South African pop idol born Jan Adriaan Hoogendyk will perform some of the hits that have made him a household name over the years. Tomorrow night, the crowd can expect chart-topping songs such as Things My Father Said, Lighthouse and Save Me, along with Rede Om Te Glo, Toe Ons Jonk Was and Die Hemel. Since he took part in and won the 2010 M-Net SA Idols competition, sharing half the profit with runner-up Lloyd Cele, he has blazed a trail with multiple South African Music Award nominations. He is the first Afrikaans artist to scale the Top Ten of the iTunes Store chart &#8212; and he cracked it on the very first day. With an average of 133 live performances a year, three platinum and one gold selling album and a long list of top 10 hits to his credit, Elvis Blue is a success, and remains a relatively rare breed in his ability to straddle both English and Afrikaans music genres. With charisma and authenticity, Elvis Blue shows are known for not only their perfect blend of well-known original hits and new music, but also for the singer s comical and often whimsical story telling. Tickets cost R130 per person and are available at TicketPro. Pre-booking is advised. For more information on the Boardwalk show contact Siya Mfundisi, 083-270-5404.
