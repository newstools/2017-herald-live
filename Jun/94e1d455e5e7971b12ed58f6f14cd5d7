The Voice SA has been marred by dodgy voting tactics Picture: Supplied M-Net has confirmed that dodgy voting tactics have made it re-evaluate the upcoming episode of The Voice SA after it was confirmed that at least two previous contestants have been called back as it emerged their exits could have been affected by &#8220;paid-for marketing efforts.&#8221; In a statement titled &#8216;M-Net gives The Voice SA talent another chance,&#8217; the broadcaster admitted that it was forced to change the format of Sunday&#8217;s show after it was alerted to paid-for marketing efforts (boosted posts) which have been running on some of the contestant&#8217;s social media accounts. These boosted posts are against the rules of the competition. In the statement, M-Net said that two previous contestants, Luke Lovemore and PJ Pretorius, had been invited back onto the show. Despite our best efforts, we could not determine with certainty whether misconduct took place and what the impact was on the voting results. We believe the fairest solution under these circumstances is to give all the affected talent another chance, Nkateko Mabaso, GM for M-Net South Africa said. None of the remaining contestants on the show will be sent home this week either and voting lines have been closed. The boosts can cause voting spikes and provide an unfair advantage in the competition. M-Net said it was alerted to the dodgy tactics and an investigation was launched. It is unclear which of the contestants had the campaigns in place. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
