Picture: Richard Pearce Photography The organisers of the Nelson Mandela Bay Athletics South Africa 21.1km championships next Saturday have thrown their weight behind the Bob1000 Initiative. An amount of R5 for every 5km entry in the event will be donated to the cancer fundraiser. I am so thrilled that Eastern Province Athletics will be supporting this cause, Westering teacher Richard Geyer said. He initiated the Bob1000 drive in honour of his late grandfather after he died in 2014 from cancer. Geyer, who ran 700km from Port Elizabeth to Durban and then took part in the Comrades Marathon, will be an ambassador for the national 21.1km championship event and will lead the 5km run. The Bob1000 donation page will close on June 26 and runners can also donate directly via https://web.facebook.com/ Bob1000run/ Participants in both the half-marathon and 5km fun run stand a chance of winning a brand-new Datsun Go vehicle, valued at R106 900, sponsored by the race s new partner, Eastern Cape Motor Group. A rolling road closure from 5.30am will ensure a safe run and minimum inconvenience for the public. The 21.1km race starts at 8am and the 5km fun run at 7.30am. Vehicles will gain access to the start from Eighth Avenue in Summerstrand, as well as from Second Avenue into the Bird Rock parking area on the sea side until 7am on race day. Parking will be available on the sea side of Marine Drive, in the Something Good parking lot and on the grass area opposite Ninth Avenue. All vehicles parked on the sea side of Marine Drive will not be able to exit before 11.30am, which is the 21.1km race cut-off time. The entry fee is R80 for the half-marathon and R30 for the fun run. A temporary licence fee (half-marathon only) costs R30. EPA-registered athletes over 65 will pay R50 for the half-marathon. Registration and late entries will take place at the Summerstrand Surf Lifesaving Club from 2pm to 8pm next Friday and from 5.30am on the morning of race day.
