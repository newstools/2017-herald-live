Picture: Brian Witbooi A truck was petrol bombed by irate protesters on the N2 near Motherwell on Tuesday night. The attack took place when the Ibhayi Cleaning Logistics truck was driving from the Coega area on its way back to their warehouse. A visibly shaken driver, Thozamile Kula said a group of people started throwing stones at him. &#8220;It was at that stage that I decided to stop and get out of the truck. The protesters started to chase me. I overheard them shout get hold of the driver but I managed to escape. I was scared,&#8221; Kula said. &nbsp; The protest started early on Tuesday morning, when eighty residents from Wells Estate were served with eviction notices by a sheriff of the court. The group gathered together and proceeded to the N2 just 500m away from Motherwell turnoff where they pelted motorists with stones and petrol bombs. Several vehicles were damaged during the incident including a bakkie that was set alight during the day. Some cars were seen making turning around from the scene and having to face oncoming traffic. The police and traffics have warned motorists to be careful when driving in the area. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
