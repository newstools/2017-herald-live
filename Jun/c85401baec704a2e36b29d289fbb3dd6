Keegan Hull (youth category) and Mabele Mtubeli (open category) were 2016 s The Herald Citizen of the Year winners. Nominations are now open for 2017. The Herald is calling for nominations for The Herald Citizen of the Year 2017 awards. This means that if you know someone who is living to leave a legacy, then this is your chance to spread the good news about what they do uplift the community. Originally launched in 1989, The Herald Citizen of the Year Award recognises those who positively contribute to the community and who aim to build and maintain community projects which support the wellbeing of others. It is a distinctly Eastern and Southern Cape project, actively seeking out unsung heroes and heroines and holding them up as ambassadors. The Herald expanded the event by introducing The Herald Youth Citizen of the Year Award in 2015. This award encourages and recognises young individuals aged from 15 to 23 who are making a positive difference in their community. The award for the Herald Young Citizen of the Year provides a platform for young individuals of the Nelson Mandela Bay Metro to be recognised for going that extra mile to make a difference for good. The Herald Citizen of the Year Awards also provides an unique opportunity to boost the morale of our region, promote positive city ambassadors and salute our legacies. We encourage YOU the public to nominate our local heroes of Nelson Mandela Bay so that we can showcase the tireless efforts these individuals put in to ensuring a better and healthier community. Here is what you will need to nominate someone: You and your nominee s name, e-mail address and phone numbers; A short motivation of 300 words for why you think this person should be recognised.
