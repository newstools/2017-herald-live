A proud Estelle Ellis with her latest award which she received last night. The Herald scooped the Best Health News Reporting category prize at the Discovery Health Journalist of the Year Awards in Sandton last night. This is the fourth time Herald health reporter Estelle Ellis has walked off with a title at the ceremony. Ellis claimed the Best Investigative Reporting award in 2012 and 2013. Last year, she took top honours in the Nation Builder of the Year category and this year walked off with the Best Health News reporting award. Ellis s award-winning article Toxic River Spill focused on a major industrial spill, which threatened to develop into an ecological disaster for the already heavily polluted Swartkops River. The spill, which was reported to the then municipal administration, was ignored for almost a month, with people falling ill and pets dying. Herald editor-in-chief Brett Horner praised Ellis for her comprehensive news-writing ability which resulted in positive change for the affected community. Estelle s focus on this story has been unrelenting and because of her work, authorities were compelled to act, he said. It s a great example of what advocacy journalism can achieve. It is in this vein that we will continue in our quest for accountability and social justice. Last night, Ellis said: I am delighted. It feels good to have your work recognised in this way.
