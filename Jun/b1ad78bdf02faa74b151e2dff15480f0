Klara van Wyk in the Fringe theatre production You Suck and Other Inescapable Truths Picture: CuePix, Jane Berg You Suck and Other Inescapable Truths, directed by Francesco Nassimbeni, with Klara van Wyk, at Princess Alice Hall, daily at 10am. Zeffer than Yolandi Visser, wackier than Corne and Twakkie, smarter than Suzelle and fresher than Dowwe Dolla, You Suck And Other Inescapable Truths is a pot of gold at the start of the festival rainbow. This short (it s only 45 minutes) Fringe production is a one-hander written by and starring Klara van Wyk. Partnered with direction by Francesco Nassimbeni, it s a tender little slice of high school depicting the rainbows of glitter and rivers of tears which go with those topsy-turvy teenage years. It s also very, very funny. Of course it takes a writer who is far from the dumb character she plays to put the material together in such a way that it hits the comedy spot and this Van Wyk does in style. Her character Grade 9 Afrikaans girl Pretina de Jager is at an English high school in Benoni and facing typically adolescent hassles: how to be one of the cool kids while juggling accountancy and mother won t let . For a girl who lists her interests as hip-hop, Instagram, Iggy Azalia and nail art, Pretina has a firm grip on what s going down in life. And when the mean girls (and guy) threaten to crush her mojo, the audience has her back because we want our new BFF to triumph against the social humiliations of youth. Lighting and a simple yet funky and colourful set and props add to the spirit of the piece. Today s show was sold out before festival even started so if you want tickets, book soon. FYI, that other babe from Benoni had better watch out. Gillian McAinsh Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
