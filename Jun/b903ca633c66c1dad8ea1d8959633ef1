Thembisile Yende was found dead in her office at Eskom Picture: Mboneni Zakhele Yende / Facebook Eskom employee David Ngwenya 44 accused of the murder of Thembisile Yende 30 says the state has an untested prima facie case against him. Ngwenya is applying for bail in the Springs Magistrate&#8217;s court in connection with Yende&#8217;s premeditated murder. Yende&#8217;s lifeless body was found at Eskom&#8217;s Pieterboth substation last month. She was strangled to death. In his affidavit Ngwenya said: &#8220;I fully deny that I committed murder and I don&#8217;t have any other previous convictions or pending cases. I&#8217;m employed at Eskom married with three children aged 17 12 and 11.&#8221; The court also heard that Ngwenya owns combined belongings to the value of R1.5 million and resides in Springs. Ngwenya was arrested on June 15 in Carletonville west of Johannesburg. Last week Sowetan reported that police seized a computer belonging to a senior supervisor at Eskom. This is after revelations that Yende had lodged a complaint with her senior supervisor before her death. Ngwenya s bail application continues.
