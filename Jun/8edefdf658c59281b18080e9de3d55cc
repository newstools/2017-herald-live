All shows will be at the Music Kitchen in Newton Park, with tickets at R50 available from Ian Mitchell on 072-994-5096.

Anything that will help rebuild their homes will be welcomed, Venn said. She added 100% of ticket proceeds would go directly towards the initiative, with all proceeds and monies made as well as donations given to be made public on their Facebook page.
