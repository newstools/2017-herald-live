The risk of asbestos contamination at 650 fire-damaged structures around Knysna is being assessed by inspectors Eden district waste management officer Johan Gie said on Tuesday. Inspected sites will be marked either with an A sign warning of the presences of asbestos or with an F indicating they are asbestos free. Gie said no material containing asbestos should be collected handled transported and disposed of by any person or contractor other than a suitably qualified authorised and approved person or organisation . The most common asbestos-containing materials are asbestos cement products in roofing material ceiling and floor tiles insulation and water pipes tanks and gutters.
