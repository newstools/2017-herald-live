I wonder how Helen Zille will be remembered? According to some, she was labelled a sellout during apartheid and now she is being treated like a criminal. It just depends on who you ask, but there are some very unhappy and angry people out there regarding a tweet on colonialism she made. Yes, she should have known that saying something like that could land her in very hot water. She should rather have stolen a few millions and broken some other laws that would bring on almost 800 charges, because doing that is the norm these days. The best part is nothing would have happened to her. She wouldn t even have had a criminal record. Why is nothing done regarding the blatant raping of our country by the ANC? Why are people scared to take on Jacob Zuma and those like him? But the minute you say something stupid, you are destroyed! Is it because they are black and if you take them on then you are going to be labelled a sellout? The ANC, and especially the ANC in the Western Cape, should rather focus on sorting out its weak links and do what the good book says: You hypocrite! First take the beam out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to remove the speck from your brother s eye. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
