A massive cash windfall of about R22-million will flow into the coffers of the Southern Kings if they are booted out of Super Rugby and play in an enlarged European Pro12 tournament. Insiders say the Eastern Cape franchise can expect the cash bonanza from TV rights for the tournament, which includes teams like Munster, Scarlets, Ospreys, Cardiff Blues and Edinburgh. Though a formal decision has yet to be made, the exit of the Kings and the Cheetahs appears to be a formality and will be made official on July 7 at a special general meeting of SA Rugby bosses. SA Rugby have already said that two teams will be cut from Super Rugby and it will be a major surprise if the axe does not fall on the Kings and Cheetahs. Apart from SA representation in the Pro12, there is now talk that the Pumas and Griquas could be playing in the Anglo-Welsh Cup next season. The future of the four teams was apparently discussed at meetings held last week. The European competition kicks off in September and ends in March, which means the Kings would have to scramble to assemble a team. The Kings deletion from Super Rugby appeared to move a step closer when the Australian Rugby Union (ARU) confirmed they would be scrapping one of their teams last week. Either Perth s Western Force or the Melbourne Rebels will be cut from next year s Super Rugby competition, which is returning to 15 teams after expanding to 18.
