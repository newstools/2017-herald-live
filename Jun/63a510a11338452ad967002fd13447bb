Christopher Panayiotou and his co accused Sinethemba Nemembe and Zolani Sibeko File picture: Eugene Coetzee Zolani Sibeko thought he had won a prize, instead he walked into a police trap that saw him arrested for Jayde Panayiotou&#8217;s murder. Organised Crime Unit&#8217;s Warrant Officer Shane Bosch testified on Monday morning that they traced Sibeko by phoning his cellphone and informed him that he had won a talk time voucher worth R500. In exchange, Sibeko supplied the friendly cellphone company agent with his parental address in Greenbushes. Court adjourned to Tuesday morning for investigating officer Captain Kanna Swanepoel to take the stand. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
