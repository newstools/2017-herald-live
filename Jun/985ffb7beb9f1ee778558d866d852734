Thembisile Yende David Ngwenya the man accused of Thembisile Yende&#8217;s murder was on Thursday denied bail by the Springs Magistrate&#8217;s Court. The court found that there was a strong case against him. The court also found that Ngwenya had not proved that there were exceptional circumstances that warranted his release on bail. &#8220;The evidence adduced by the applicant [Ngwenya] fell short of satisfying this court that exceptional circumstances exist&#8230;&#8221; the court found. Ngwenya an Eskom technician is accused of murdering Yende who was also an Eskom employee. He faces one count of premeditated murder. Thembisile&#8217;s body was found 13 days after she had disappeared. Her decomposing body was found in a store room next to her office in Pieterboth sub-station in Springs on the East Rand. Post-mortem results revealed that she was strangled and hit with an object on the head. During Ngwenya&#8217;s bail application this week the court heard that a key witness had told the police that Yende was killed because she knew of Ngwenya&#8217;s alleged copper dealings and was about to report his activities to Eskom managers. Ngwenya allegedly enlisted the help of a sangoma to ensure that he and his accomplices were &#8220;invisible&#8221; when they murdered Thembisile. The court also heard that Ngwenya had been seeing Yende for more than a year and was a frequent visitor at the Pieterboth substation at which she worked. Thembisile had been working at Eskom as a trainee technician. She joined the power utility in 2015. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
