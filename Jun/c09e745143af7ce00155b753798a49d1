EXCELLENT TIMES: Men s and women s winners of the Home &amp; Equity 10km Road Race, Melikhaya Frans and Ntombesinthu Mfunzi Picture: EUGENE COETZEE Both the medal contenders in Saturday s Nelson Mandela Bay SA Half-Marathon championships rounded off their preparations with excellent wins in the Home &amp; Equity 10km at the weekend. The course for the race, organised by the Body Concept Road Warriors running club, covered part of the route for the national championship. Despite gusting wind, Melikhaya Frans won the men s category in a very good time of 30:12, ahead of Andile Motwana and Zolani Ngqaqa, both medal contenders on Saturday. Ntombesinthu Mfunzi won the women s category in 35:57, easily beating Ndileka Mvakwendlu and Luthando Nxanisa. Bluewater Bay athlete Mzwanele Maphekula, whose hopes of a gold medal finish in the recent Comrades Marathon were dashed after he was forced to pull out 20km from the finish, won the 40-44 men s category in 33:29. At 63, veteran Margie Saunders proved that she can compete (and beat) the youngsters. Her finishing time of 43:56 was better than any of the junior women. In an unusual touch, organisers awarded cash prizes to the athletes who finished last in both the 10km and 5km races. And in another first, gold and silver medals were awarded to walkers in both the men s and women s categories. The leading results were: Senior men: 1 Melikhaya Frans (EPA) 30:12, 2 Andile Motwana (EPA) 30:27, 3 Zolani Ngqaqa (Tinarha) 30:48.
