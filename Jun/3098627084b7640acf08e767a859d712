Russell Domingo Picture: Johan Rynners/Gallo Images Cricket South Africa (CSA) are advertising for a head coach even as the national team are reeling from one poor result to the next in England. In a notice that runs to 730 words CSA s website says the board is considering the position of the Proteas head coach until at least the end of the 2019 World Cup. That might come as news to the incumbent Russell Domingo who was asked on Sunday whether he had clarity over his situation. No Domingo replied. Had he applied for the job? No not yet no. Could he say if he was interested in taking the team to the 2019 World Cup? Can t say. Did he have any thoughts of what he may do a few months from now if he was no longer South Africa s coach? No thoughts yet. If Domingo wants to stay in the job which Faf du Plessis AB de Villiers and Dean Elgar have said they want him to do he had better get a move-on applications close tomorrow. CSA has appointed a committee consisting of two of Domingo s predecessors Gary Kirsten and Eric Simons and administrators Norman Arendse Rihan Richards and Oupa Nkagisang to find and recommend candidates to the board. And all this while South Africa are trying to focus on the T20 series that starts in Southampton on Wednesday and next month s test series. They lost the one-day series in England and shambled out of the Champions Trophy in embarrassing fashion with a crushing loss to India at The Oval on Sunday.
