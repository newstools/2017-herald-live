Every now and then I play shrink as well she said. The songstress explained that one of her male fans once asked her to intervene in his relationship after he messed up. There was a guy that asked me to call and apologise to his wife because he had messed up so much. So there I was in the middle of the day calling&#8230; I could hear that she was broken and she was hurt but we had a woman to woman talk, she said.
