A video purportedly showing a firefighter reviving a tortoise he saved from a fire in Knysna earlier this week, was shared with The Herald today. The firefighter found the unconscious tortoise and took it to safety in town where we poured water on its head until it started moving and drinking. Watch the video here (video supplied by Southern Cape Fire Protection Association.) Yesterday Knysna and Plettenberg Bay were officially declared provincial disaster areas by the Western Cape cabinet following the devastating fires that ripped through the coastal towns last week. Nearly 1200 firefighters tackled the blaze, aome of them are retired firefighters who volunteered. &nbsp; Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
