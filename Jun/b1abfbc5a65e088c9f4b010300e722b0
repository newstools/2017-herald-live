Eid celebrations are set to take place on Monday, based on the sighting of the new moon which signifies the start of the month of Shawaal, the 10th month on the Islamic lunar calendar. Motorists can expect heavy traffic on the stretch of road as more than 8 000 Muslims are expected to attend the open-air prayers to be conducted at the Eidgah, a special area designated for the service just off Bramlin Road. Islamic scholar Nazir Desai asked motorists to exercise caution on the road or to use alternative routes as prayers commence from 7.30am to 9.30am. On completion of the holy month of Ramadan, Muslims throughout the world commence with Eid celebrations by firstly offering a special prayer service in which all Muslims render thanksgiving to the Lord Most High for guiding them through this holy month, he said.
