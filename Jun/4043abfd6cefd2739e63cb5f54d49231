Bay deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani with UDM supporters File picture: Eugene Coetzee Kwankwa describes him as destructive, arrogant Deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani is arrogant and destructive, a heady combination which has not only dented the image of the UDM, but also portrays him as an individual who is above the party. This is according to UDM deputy president and MP Nqabayomzi Kwankwa, who believes Nelson Mandela Bay s second in command should be reined in by the party. Some within the party have even proposed that Bobani s behaviour be dealt with by the UDM s national office-bearers, Kwankwa said yesterday. This comes as leaders of the DA and UDM battle to resolve the rifts between Bobani and mayor Athol Trollip, which have been dragging on for months and threaten to tear apart the coalition formed in the Bay after the August elections. While the impasse, as well as the allegations levelled against each other by both Bobani and Trollip, are being probed by the leaders, Kwankwa believes that Bobani s behaviour should be dealt with separately by the party. He cited last week s mayoral committee meeting, which Bobani is said to have disrupted, as an example of behaviour that had to be nipped in the bud. Kwankwa also bemoaned the fact that Bobani continuously disregarded instructions not to speak to the media on problems within the coalition. He said Bobani s behaviour brings the UDM into disrepute. Bobani declined to comment yesterday. For the full story read The Herald, or get the complete newspaper, including comics, classifieds, crosswords and back editions in our e-Edition.
