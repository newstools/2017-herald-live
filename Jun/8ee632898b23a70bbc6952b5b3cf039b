In a bid to stop what it termed the brutal removal of residents who invade land in Nelson Mandela Bay, the ANC wants all the power to decide on evictions vested with the council. However, while its motion of public importance was debated by the council yesterday, no decision was taken as it was tabled under a rule which does not allow for a decision. ANC councillor Rory Riordan, who tabled the motion, said: We move that no removal of individuals or families and communities must be effected without being fully motivated in a report to council. The support contained in the motion must be approved or turned down by a vote of council. His request, had it been approved, would have effectively moved the decision to approach the court to evict illegal land occupants from the mayor and city administrators to the council. Patriotic Alliance councillor Marion Daniels said his party did not agree with evictions but also did not condone the invasion of land. On the other hand, the EFF s Lukhanyo Mrara criticised city officials who apply for court interdicts. ANC councillor Makhi Feni said residents must be offered alternative accommodation if they are to be removed from where they have occupied the land. Human settlements political head Nqaba Bhanga criticised Riordan and accused him of justifying lawlessness. He referred to a number of instances of land occupation which had become a stumbling block for the development of houses for qualified beneficiaries.
