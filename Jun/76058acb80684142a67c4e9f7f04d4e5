The impasse between former DA leader Helen Zille may be resolved on Tuesday pending a proposed &#8220;political solution&#8221; by current leader Mmusi Maimane. Maimane has asked Zille to accede to a political agreement that serves both the country and the party to end the standoff over her tweets on colonialism. The DA&#8217;s federal executive committee will meet on Tuesday to ratify the agreement between Zille and the party. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
