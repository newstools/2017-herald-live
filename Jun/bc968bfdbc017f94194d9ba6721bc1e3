Mnisi said the department condemned the violent way in which the drivers had blocked the roads earlier. They were supposed to protest peacefully but they did otherwise. However we welcome the positive outcome that came out of all this chaos he said Anger and frustration boiled over as commuters were caught up in a massive taxi strike that brought parts of Johannesburg &#8211; the economic hub of the country &#8211; to a halt on Thursday.
