I would like to respond to the threat by the ANC spokesman, Gift Ngqondi, regarding uncollected rubbish ( Collect township rubbish soon or else, ANC warns , June 13). We have lived in an area on the new Seaview road for about 32 years and never have had the privilege of having our refuse removed. Even with all the rate increases over the years, this is something we have just accepted and once a week I drop off my refuse at the local dump site. There are times when we just have to be patient and wait until the situation is resolved. The refuse from our office premises has not been collected over the past few weeks, but I have no intention of threatening the municipality.
