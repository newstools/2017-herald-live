I encourage community members to share information about anyone who may have illegal firearms in their communities. Family members who are keeping firearms belonging to deceased relatives must hand them over to the police while making necessary arrangements for new licenses to possess them, Eastern Cape Provincial Commissioner, Lieutenant-General Liziwe Ntshinga said. We will continue with our targeted and informed deployment of resources to ensure that those who continue to terrorise innocent people are brought to book.
