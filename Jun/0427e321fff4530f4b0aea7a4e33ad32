Westering started hosting this festival every second year from 1999 and it has become a permanent date on many schools calendars. It has grown over the years and now hosts more than 800 pupils and 12 staff members in three U19 sporting codes. These are rugby, netball and hockey (boys and girls), and the action will take place all weekend. Schools from as far afield as Cape Town and East London will join a number of Bay teams in the weekend s action. We are proud to be hosting the 10th edition of our festival this weekend, festival director Stephen Harris said. Westering High have been fortunate enough to have enjoyed good support over the years and we look forward to a bumper sporting weekend. The festival has grown really well in terms of participation since it was first conceived and this year we have all of 18 schools taking part. There should be some competitive fixtures across all the sporting codes.
