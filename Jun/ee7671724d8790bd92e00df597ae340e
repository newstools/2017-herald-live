A police investigation is under way after a group of 27 boys were illegally circumcised in Scenery Park East London the Eastern Cape health department said. Spokesperson Sizwe Kupelo said police traditional leaders and health officials raided the initiation school on Sunday afternoon. They were accompanied by some of the parents whose children had been circumcised without their consent. Police are now looking for at least four people or traditional nurses believed to have been responsible for the illegal circumcisions said Kupelo. Experienced traditional nurses [have since been] appointed to take care of them after assessments found them to be in [a] good health condition and their surgical procedures were done properly he added. It is believed that the boys had been kept at the school since Friday. Their parents have since opened cases with the police. Kupelo could not immediately confirm what the charges are.
