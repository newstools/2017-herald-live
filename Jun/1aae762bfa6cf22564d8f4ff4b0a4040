Tito Mboweni Picture: TimesLIVE Former Reserve Bank governor Tito Mboweni has said that any changes to the bank&#8217;s mandate could have huge implications. He called for calm after public protector Busisiwe Mkhwebane proposed such an amendment on Monday. &#8220;I hope the PP [public protector] has consulted widely about her proposals in this regard. One cannot just take this for granted. This is too fundamental to be treated this easily &#8221; Mboweni said in a Facebook post. &#8220;The impact of any proposed changes are huge for our country. In any case one requires a huge majority in Parliament to effect the suggested Constitutional changes which no Party in Parliament currently commands.&#8221; Mkhwebane&#8217;s report revolved around a bailout granted by the Reserve Bank to apartheid-era bank Bankorp which was bought by Absa. Mkhwebane recommended that government take legal action to recover R1.125-billion in public funds unlawfully given to Absa. But it was her statement around the Reserve Bank&#8217;s mandate that raised eyebrows. Mkhwebane said she would approach parliament regarding a constitutional amendment to adjust the Reserve Bank&#8217;s mandate to include enhancing South Africans&#8217; socioeconomic conditions. Mboweni was Reserve Bank governor during the time when the Absa allegations were brought to authorities&#8217; attention. He said he was travelling abroad and had yet to study the report. However he did not believe that Mkhwebane had any ulterior motives. &#8220;I will respond to the PP&#8217;s report in due time. I don&#8217;t think that the PP&#8217;s report was meant to fuel political issues in this year of schizophrenic political tensions. She was just doing her job within the available capabilities. Stay calm. No heroics needed &#8221; Mboweni said. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
