Relief organisation Gift of the Givers needs feed for livestock and horses Picture: Gift of the Givers Donations from around the country have been flooding into the fire ravaged town of Knysna. But the City of Cape Town has had to close its donation points. It would appear that residents generosity knows no bounds. The City of Cape Town would like to express its sincere gratitude to all those who opened their hearts to the residents of Knysna by dropping off donations at four designated fire stations publicised in the wake of the disaster mayoral committee member JP Smith said. The response has been completely overwhelming to the point where we have received more than we could have hoped for. The city will therefore be closing the donation points. Meanwhile disaster relief foundation Gift of the Givers has appealed for horse and livestock feed donations. The foundation is also providing food and medical supplies to pet shelters in Knysna George Plettenberg Bay Port Elizabeth and Uitenhage. According to a statement on the foundation s website: The Knysna Fire aggravated the existing drought which destroyed substantial hectares of grazing land. Fortunately farmers in the Free State have opened up their hearts and have donated close to 1 600 bales of fodder to Gift of the Givers. At our cost transport has commenced. We will require 25 superlinks to complete the process. The feed of various types will come from Hertzogville Bultfontein Welkom Wesselsbron and Ventersburg. To date Gift of the Givers has distributed 5 000 food parcels to individuals and families. In addition it had delivered liquids and food to 12 000 firefighters every day. &#8211; TimesLIVE &nbsp; &nbsp; Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
