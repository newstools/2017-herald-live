The DA is demanding that the finance ministry immediately release reports on alleged corruption at South African Airways (SAA). For seven months the DA has been requesting these reports. National Treasury has refused to hand them over DA deputy finance spokesman Alf Lees said yesterday. Last month Deputy Finance Minister Sfiso Buthelezi promised to release these reports to the finance committee [but] he has failed to make good on this promise Lees said. There can be no further delays particularly if the reports confirm the South African Cabin Crew Association s allegations of widespread corruption at [SAA]. The reports included investigations of: The sale of surplus materials such as rotables and consumables; SAA Technical with respect to commercial aircraft leases between SAA and Mango; Various allegations against primarily former SAA chief executive Khaya Ngqula; and The alleged irregular awarding of a tender for dry snacks by Air Chefs. Lees said though this was not confirmed that he was informed SAA chairwoman Dudu Myeni had copies of the investigation reports with her when she appeared before parliament s standing committee on finance on Tuesday but had not submitted them to the committee. The meeting could not deal with the issues on the agenda as no board members were present. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
