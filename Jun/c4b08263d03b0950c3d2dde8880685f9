M-Net has confirmed that the voting scandal which has hit the reality music competition did involve members of the Top 5 on The Voice SA but has refused to name the guilty parties, insisting it could influence the next voting period. The past two weeks saw favourites PJ Pretorius and Luke Lovemore booted off. However they have since been invited back onto the show after it emerged illicit paid-for marketing campaigns which are against the competition s rules were being used by some of the contestants. The current Top 5 are Caroline Brussow Craig Lucas Fatman Josh Ansley and Samantha Leonard. M-Net said it would not be taking action against any of the contestants as it was unable to determine if misconduct did occur and if it had any impact on the votes. The issue was brought to M-Net s attention after one of the remaining contestants wanted to clarify the parameters of campaigning. There have been questions about why M-Net has been lenient on the guilty parties, but it insists that even though an investigation by its social media monitoring auditing and legal teams was conducted there was still no proof of wrongdoing. We believed that the fairest solution under these circumstances was to extend an invitation to the talent who might have been affected by the boosts to return to the show M-Net s Lani Lombard said. Should Pretorius and Lovemore accept the invitation, they would participate in the semifinals on Sunday. However voting has been shut and no one will go home.
