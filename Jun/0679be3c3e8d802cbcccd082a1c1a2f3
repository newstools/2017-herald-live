UNDER CONTROL: Military helicopters were used to fight the latest fires that broke out between Woodridge and Blue Horizon Bay yesterday morning Picture: EUGENE COETZEE Following days of devastating fires that raged through parts of Nelson Mandela Bay and the Kouga region, new fires broke out in the metro yesterday. Firefighters were sent to the Blue Horizon Bay area as well as the Baakens Valley. A South African National Defence Force chopper was seen waterbombing Blue Horizon Bay. Last week, the metro dealt with raging fires that claimed the lives of Walter and Myrna van der Riet in the Van Stadens gorge area, caused widespread damage to Woodridge College and left families in the surrounding areas homeless. Nelson Mandela Bay spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said yesterday the Blue Horizon Bay fires were not threatening any homes. He said the fires had been contained, with five fire engines dispatched to monitor and work on the fires overnight. He said the Baakens Valley fire had been extinguished earlier in the day. It was not a major fire, but the worrying factor is that it could have easily moved to property, Mniki said. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
