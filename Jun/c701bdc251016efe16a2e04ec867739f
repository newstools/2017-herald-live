The presidency on Sunday denied that President Jacob Zuma owns a property in Dubai. The Sunday Times reported that Zuma owned a property on Lailak Street in Emirates Hills billed as the &#8220;most expensive postal code&#8221; in a city so flashy that the police drive Bugattis according to leaked e-mails. It was also reported that Zimbabwean leader Robert Mugabe s lived nearby. &#8220;President Zuma does not own any property outside South Africa and has not requested anybody to buy property for him abroad &#8221; the presidency said in a statement on Sunday. &#8220;The president has also not received or seen the reported emails and has no knowledge of them.&#8221; The Sunday Times published a photograph on its front page of the palatial home which it said comes complete with 10 bedrooms 13 bathrooms a double grand staircase nine reception rooms and space for 11 cars. The top-of-the-range fittings feature an excess of marble mosaic and gold. The sparkling pool fringed with palm trees is larger than the &#8220;fire pool&#8221; at Zuma&#8217;s Nkandla compound. Close by in the same luxury estate is a house that was owned by Mugabe. Although less opulent than the Zuma palace it nevertheless features 10 bedrooms the report said. It said that during a Sunday Times investigative trip to Dubai last year several independent sources told the newspaper the Guptas had bought Zuma a R330-million retirement home in the upmarket suburb of Emirates Hill in 2015 the same year that Duduzane had bought an apartment for R18-million in the the Burj Khalifa.
