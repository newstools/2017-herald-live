Twenty percent of South Africa&#8217;s teachers believe that schools are violent places and suspect their students and colleagues are armed. This is according to a survey conducted by the Human Sciences Research Council with the Department of Education among more than 20000 teachers at 1380 schools across the country. About 17% of teachers reported fights involving weapons at school and almost 13% of teachers believe gangs operate in their school. Most reported violence was between pupils or between a pupil and a teacher. Basil Manuel, the executive director of the National Professional Teachers&#8217; Organisation of SA, said yesterday that a principal in Lavender Hill in the Western Cape was recently stabbed by a parent who then returned to the school afterwards &#8220;to finish him [the principal] off&#8221;. &#8220;The principal has left and no one wants to replace him. You must be slightly soft in the head to take the job,&#8221; he said. SA Democratic Teachers&#8217; Union spokesman Mugwena Maluleke said: &#8220;Teachers feel unsafe in our schools. The young ones in particular &#8211; violence is why they resign &#8211; not only the low salary.&#8221; Education spokesman Elijah Mhlanga said the department was &#8221;extremely concerned&#8221; about violence in schools. &#8221;We are extremely concerned about the violence that takes place in school. &#8221;It&#8217;s even more worrying when the violence is against teachers whose job is to impart information to learners. &#8221;It becomes difficult when they have to teach while thinking about defending themselves. Some of the learners use weapons and as a Department we can&#8217;t tolerate it,&#8221; he said. Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
