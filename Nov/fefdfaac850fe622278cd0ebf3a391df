Just a week after South African Airways (SAA) slashed its flights to Port Elizabeth, another airline has stepped up to fill the gap.
British Airways (BA), operated by Comair, added two daily flights between Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg to its roster yesterday.
From October 29, SAA reduced its flights on this route from four to two a day.
BA spokesman Luane Lavery said the decision to add flights was spurred by increased demand.
“We believe the increased frequency of flights will support the economic and tourism growth in one of the most beautiful and economically important parts of our country,” Lavery said


The flights will leave Johannesburg and Port Elizabeth at 1.15pm and 3.35pm respectively on weekdays.
The airline had previously offered five return flights between Port Elizabeth and Johannesburg.
The extra flights were welcomed by businesses in the metro.
Nelson Mandela Bay Business Chamber spokeswoman Cindy Preller said: “For many of our member companies, domestic routes are vital for doing business with other cities and countries.”
Volkswagen South Africa spokesman Matt Gennrich said: “We are delighted that British Airways has, unlike SAA, listened to the call by business to have sufficient flights serving the routes that suit not only the local but also the international traveller.”
