 The bill for the only two fully state-funded frail care centres in the Eastern Cape will be split in future between the provincial departments of health and social development, it was decided at a high-level meeting in Bhisho last week.

Social development spokesman Mzukisi Solani said the health department would now pay for all medical needs and support of the patients at the two frail care centres.


He said a delegation from the province, comprising officials from the departments of social development, health and treasury, would visit the Algoa and Lorraine frail care centres next week and finalise their plans.
The Department of Social Development has been ordered by the Port Elizabeth High Court to first provide a plan that must be approved by an advocate appointed for the frail care residents before they are moved anywhere.
Solani said a cost breakdown of the proposed tariff would be analysed to ensure that each department incurred costs for responsibilities in line with its mandate.
He said a final decision would be taken after a visit to the two centres.
Solani said patients at the two centres would not be moved “yet”.
Health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo denied there was any agreement between the two departments other than an undertaking to look after the patients at the two centres when they were ill.
“Social development is responsible to care for the frail and elderly persons,” he said.
“The frail and elderly are a different category from mental patients, to whom the department offers medical and institutional care.”
In papers before court, the social development department said it believed more than 80 patients could be moved to homes for the disabled and regular old age homes.
Social development currently pays close to R19 000 a patient at the two centres, which house 271 residents.
Last year, the department did not renew its contract with Eastern Cape Frail Care, a company in the Life Healthcare Group operating the Algoa and Lorraine frail care centres in Port Elizabeth.
The plan was to move the patients into the care of non-profit or non-government organisation.
However, none of the organisations approached were willing to take the patients at the rate the department offered.
After a second round, organisations willing to take patients for the subsidy offered by the department fell short of requirements for a frail care facility.
