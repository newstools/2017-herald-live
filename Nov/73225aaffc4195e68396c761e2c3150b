Bodies found in locked room of ransacked Summerstrand home
A daughter’s frantic voice message led to the discovery yesterday of the bodies of her elderly parents, who had been butchered with an axe in their high-security Summerstrand home during a weekend robbery.
Andre Saaiman, 65, and his wife Lidia, 69, were found hacked to death inside a locked room in their Scott Street home shortly before 8am yesterday.
Police are now looking for a gardener who lived in a caravan on the premises and is missing.
They have described him as a person of interest.
The brutal murders come little more than a month after Ken Alexander, 76, and Elaine Allwright, 78, were fatally attacked at their Schoenmakerskop home.
The Saaimans’ property, which has entrances in Scott Street and Second Avenue, has a main house in which the couple lived, but is surrounded by several student flatlets on the same erf.
A signboard, Rustica Lodge, is on the outside of the fortified premises and, according to neighbours, it was known to be mainly a university student commune.
CCTV cameras cover both the front and back of the house, with barbed wire and an electric fence surrounding the perimeter walls.
Andre was a retired businessman, who previously owned Saaiman’s Rust Pro Body Shop in North End.
According to one of Lidia’s recent Facebook posts, the couple’s 45th wedding anniversary was on October 7.
The alarm was raised by their daughter, Leandra Pickard, who arrived at the house at 7.30am following a call from the handyman who assisted Andre with maintenance at the property.
On seeing that the house had been ransacked, as well as traces of blood, Pickard sent a distressed voice note to the community security WhatsApp group – which is linked to police and security companies – in which she screamed for help.
“Can someone please send security, please send security!”
Atlas Security operations manager Monty Montgomery – whose company has a CCTV camera situated less than 100m from the residence, connected to their control room – said his team was first on the scene.
“When we arrived, the front gates were still closed and she [Pickard] was outside the house on her hands and knees, crying and screaming and banging the ground,” he said.
“We went straight inside and found the house ransacked.
“By that stage, the bodies had not been found and it was thought they had been kidnapped.”
Police arrived minutes later and went from room to room with the security officials.
“We then found one door locked,” Montgomery said.
“The police kicked it open and the bodies were found.”
Police spokesman Warrant Officer Alwin Labans said the couple’s bodies were found a few metres apart, in what is believed to be the study, their hands bound with cable ties, and an axe lying nearby on the floor.
“They appeared to have been killed with the axe. There are no signs of forced entry,” he said.
Police were still trying to determine what was missing.
“At this stage, we suspect this was a house robbery which escalated into a murder,” he said.
The couple had been seen last on Saturday afternoon.
“The gardener is a person of interest and is being sought for questioning,” Labans said.
A distraught Pickard told later how she had been rushed off to hospital where she was given sedatives for shock.
“This is a dream. I am in shock. I cannot believe it. They are gone,” she said, choking back the tears.
“The safe is open and the money and guns are gone.”
By 8.30am, curious residents were milling around, trying to see what had happened, as police and security officials blocked off the street.


Mount Road Cluster commander Major-General Funeka Siganga and Humewood police station head Brigadier Leonie Bentley were on the scene.
Metro EMS operations manager Ashwell Botha said the couple had been dead for some time.
Montgomery said: “There is a lot of movement around the house [on CCTV footage] as it is student accommodation.
“We will be handing all the footage to the police so they can check all the vehicles that came in and out of the house and street over the weekend.”


Pickard posted a message to the same WhatsApp group later: “My parents have been murdered, they have been taken away in a non-human way!
“They are at the feet of the Lord! I am broken and sore.
“Now I put my trust in the police! We have to catch them.”
Several students living at the commune sat outside the house in shock. They declined to talk about the incident, saying police had told them not to talk to the media.
Neighbours, who declined to be named, said the Saaimans were religious but mostly kept to themselves.
“They have been living here since prior to 1995, when I moved here,” a resident said.
“I have only seen them a handful of times and have spoken to him [Andre] once.
“They always kept to themselves and were very private people. “We are all shocked by this.” Another resident said the Saaiman property was always very busy due to the student accommodation.
“There are always people in and out because of the students living there. It would be very difficult to see anything out of the ordinary because it is a busy property.”
A neighbour said they had alerted police and security after hearing screams from the house.
“I just heard screaming [yesterday] morning.
“At that stage, no one knew what was happening.”
