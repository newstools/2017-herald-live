It was a sombre moment on Monday morning as the families of three struggle heroes who were executed in Pretoria more than 50 years ago laid wreaths on their graves in Port Elizabeth.
Vuyisile Mini, Wilson Khayingo and Zinakile Mkhaba were executed in the Pretoria Gallows on November 6, 1964.
They were remembered at a moving ceremony where loved ones laid wreaths at the Paapenkuil Cemetery in Gelvandale and Emlotheni Memorial Park in New Brighton.
Mkhaba’s granddaughter Nomsa Mkhaba said she was happy to see her grandfather’s contribution appreciated.
“This shows that they are recognised,” Mkhaba said.
ANC Veterans League president Snuki Zikalala was also among those in attendance.
“It is 53 years since they were executed on that fateful day. Their sin was that they were fighting for freedom,” he said.
“It is generally acknowledged that there is no greater sacrifice. Comrade Mini, Khayingo, Mkhaba and others distinguished themselves as some of the most illustrious and brave sons of Africa. Their stories are yet to be told fully.
“These comrades went to the gallows singing with pride.”
ANC provincial chairman Oscar Mabuyane said the day was a day of revival for the ANC.
“These are people who lived the national democratic revolution. They represented the aspirations of the poor. This day makes us think about where we are headed,” Mabuyane said.
