 Shekhinah Picture: Veli Nhlapo
There seems to be no stopping pop singer Shekhinah, who continues to dominate charts with her hits and cement her place as a force to be reckoned with.
Earlier this week it was announced that Shekhinah would be the opening act for the highly anticipated John Legend Tour SA tour taking place this weekend in Johannesburg and Durban.
The Suited hitmaker told TshisaLIVE that she was super grateful for the opportunity and planned to blow fans away.
Even though opening for John Legend comes with an incredible amount of pressure‚ Shekhinah said she planned to stay true to who she was.
“We’ve been rehearsing and rehearsing but we really just want to represent who we are. We won’t be doing anything that we are not known for because it is important for me that I remain true to who I am, even as I open for an artist as big as him‚” she said.
Shekhinah said she believed she had changed as an artist since the first time she met Legend back in 2012.
“This will be the second time I am in John Legend’s presence. I first met him back in 2012‚ during season eight of
“Idols SA” when he came to meet the top seven.
“I was impressed by how he took the time to speak to us individually because international stars don’t usually have time. He was really nice‚ but more than that he’s a great musician‚ and now I’ve come full circle.”
The singer said she was looking forward to hearing her favourite jams from the “So High”, hitmaker‚ which includes “Ordinary People”‚ “PDA” and “They Say” featuring rappers Kanye West and Common.
She will open for Legend at his Johannesburg and Durban shows.
His “Darkness and Light” Tour kicks off this weekend at the Ticketpro Dome in Joburg‚ before moving to Durban on November 7.
