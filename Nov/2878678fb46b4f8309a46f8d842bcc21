Prosthetic invention wins Collegiate schoolgirl bursary to study science`
After encountering people who had lost a hand or had a congenital defect, Grade 12 Collegiate Girls High School pupil Samantha Woods felt inspired to create a prosthetic hand made from recycled shopping bags.
Her efforts have secured the 18-year-old from Mill Park a four-year study bursary to Stellenbosch University after the Eskom Expo for Young Scientists International Science Fair last month.
Woods began exploring alternative options to create a lightweight, battery operated prototype prosthetic hand that would have a positive impact on the environment as well.
“I have always been interested in prosthetics and wanted to help people, particularly in the South African climate where groups of people are able to help those who can’t afford a prosthetic hand,” she said.
“This is what I wanted to do after school as well – to go into prosthetics with a particular focus on the robotics side of things.”
Woods designed her first prototype two years ago and decided to enter the expo again before leaving school this year.
“I want to help people to better their quality of life and, while my invention is at a starting point, I still hope to improve it,” she said.
Woods will be studying electrical engineering at Stellenbosch after landing a Siemens bursary for outstanding achievement at the expo.
“It’s an amazing thing to walk away with, but that was the goal for entering,” she said.
“I won a bronze award and, after winning, I cried the whole night, because I couldn’t believe it.
“I have always been interested in science and looking into the engineering aspect. It is a passion of mine.”
The prosthetic hand, which is made from melted plastic shopping bags, offers five hand positions using basic bionic functionality such as holding a cellphone, a cup and a pinch grip along with its adjustable velcro strap.
“The goal is to get it used by amputees and improve its bionic functioning, with a wider range of abilities as well as improving the quality,” Woods said.
“It cost me R480 to make and, only once I am completely satisfied with it, will it be tested on people.”
Eskom Expo director Parthy Chetty said many pupils at this year’s expo sought to address some form of disability, which blew the judges away.
“A significant number of the projects that are entered every year tackle societal problems, from renewable energy through to animal conservation and recycling,” she said.
“But this year we have seen an outstanding selection of projects that aim to assist people living with disabilities. It is so encouraging.”
