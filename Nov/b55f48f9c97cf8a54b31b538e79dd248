 Celebrating their 106km Classic win this year are the top three pro riders – Clint Hendricks of Team Road Cover, left, Nolan Hoffman of Team BCX and Rohan du Plooy of Team Giant
Elite field of cyclists set to vie for titles in next year’s event
There will be yet another strong lineup of elite riders gunning for top honours in next year’s The Herald Continental Cycle Tour.
Nolan Hoffman, of Team BCX, will return to defend his 106km Classic title, while Port Elizabeth’s own Anriette Schoeman will look to retain both her 80km mountain bike and 106km road race titles.

KwaZulu-Natal’s Andrew Hill will be keen for another 80km victory on the Addo trails.
Team Giant manager Hannes van der Walt said his team enjoyed racing in Port Elizabeth, where they always got good results.
It was probably the most well-organised race in the country, he said.
“We love coming to this race and being part of its history. It’s one of the big races to win in South Africa!”
Van der Walt said they had a great experience this year and were treated like real professionals.
“The food and accommodation could not have been better,” he said. “Staying at the Radisson Blu made logistics easy.
“It’s great to walk out of the hotel to the start and finish line.”
Team Giant are looking forward to having another good experience at next year’s event, and maybe bettering their third-place finish (Rohan du Plooy in the 106km Classic) with a win.
Schoeman said The Herald Continental Cycle Tour was close to her heart, because she loves the Eastern Cape and Port Elizabeth.
Being the biggest cycling event in the Eastern Cape, she said she was proud to be part of the race that boasts beautiful and scenic roads, as well as the incredible hospitality and history of this iconic event.


“I did the MTB event for the first time this year and I absolutely loved it,” she said.
“Splitting [the MTB and road races] over two weekends made it possible to be competitive in both events, and being in February makes it an ideal event to prepare for the Cape Town Cycle Tour in March.
“The vibe at the event is very festive and the local support has been amazing. My sponsors also get a chance to get fantastic exposure, which is always important.
“Because the event is so well organised, I always look forward to a great and enjoyable day on the bike — irrespective of the result — and a beautiful, scenic race, which makes the safety of the riders a priority.”
Hoffman considers the Cycle Tour to be a home ground race because of all the support he gets from the Port Elizabeth crowd.
“This year’s race was very tough! We had rain, wind and a lot of attacking throughout the day. But the sun came out during the last 40km for a dry sprint at the finish.
“The race organisers really looked after all the teams well by putting them up in the same hotel. It gives you a real feeling of a European event.”
Hoffman hopes to be in winning form next year to make it five victories in a row.
“That would be a nice goal to achieve for me.”
The hospitality and warmth of the people behind the scenes at this year’s event was world class, mountain biker Hill said.
Even with the gloomy weather and muddy conditions in Addo, he really enjoyed himself.
“Everything about the pre-event lead-up, the hospitality at Zuurberg and race day was world class and seamless.
“There aren’t many race organising committees who put that much effort into making the stay great,” Hill said.
The MTB races take place on February 18 at the Addo Polo Club — the 80km Extreme starting at 6am, and the 60km Adventure at 6.15am.
Riders for the Corporate Team Challenge will need to be at the start line at 7am on February 24 at Pollok Beach.
The 106km Classic on February 25 starts at 6am at Pollok Beach, and the 55km Pursuit at 8am.
Race packs can be collected at Pollok Beach from 9am to 7pm on February 16, on February 17 from 9am to 1pm, on February 23 from 9am to 7pm and from 9am to 1pm on February 24.
Entries close on January 28 at midnight. Online entries only.
