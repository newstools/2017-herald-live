 November is Diabetes month and to raise awareness Wahieda Soomar, who is a 6 year old Type 1 diabetic child hosted a “Jump for Diabetes” event at Gravity Indoor Trampoline ParkPicture: Werner Hills
A lack of understanding and awareness has prompted the Nelson Mandela Bay chapter of Diabetes SA to launch the Young Guns campaign aimed at tackling and highlighting the disease Young Guns was initiated by 17 members of Diabetes SA in the Bay about two months ago.
It will drive an awareness campaign throughout the metro educating youngsters about type 1 diabetes and its life-threatening effects.
Aiming to target schools, particularly those in townships, through the use of presentations and discussions, the campaign hopes to educate pupils and encourage them and their parents to get tested for the chronic disease.
Yesterday, the Young Guns hosted their inaugural “Jump for Diabetes” event at the Gravity Trampoline Park in Framesby, opposite Macro.
“The life of a type 1 diabetic is a lonely one. The aim of these events is to gather as many type 1 diabetics in the same space to interact and realise that they are not alone,” campaign chairwoman Paula Thorn said.
“Children with type 1 are often bullied as a result of having to use insulin. We want these kids to realise there is support out there for them.”
Young Guns member Wahieda Soomar said: “I am a mother of a six-year-old type 1 diabetic.
“Diabetes is a life-threatening illness, a parent of a type 1 diabetic never knows when that phone call from the school will come telling you that your child has been rushed to ICU, or whether your child will wake up in the morning,” she said.
“This campaign aims to create awareness among young children who are often diagnosed with diabetes after 20 years, unaware that they had it. By the time they find out it is too late.”
Diabetes SA Port Elizabeth branch chairman Martin Prinsloo said the greatest asset in the fight against diabetes was , an awareness of the disease.
