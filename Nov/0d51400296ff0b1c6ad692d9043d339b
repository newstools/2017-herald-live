 Normally it’s the daughters who follow in the mothers’ footsteps, but for two Nelson Mandela Bay families, the moms are following their children’s lead in entering and excelling in a talent search.
For the past seven years, talent agent Elsubie Verlinden has travelled the country to find talent to send overseas to participate in the Applause Rising Talent Showcase (Arts).
Although there are several successful entrants from Port Elizabeth, this is the first time that a double mother and daughter team form the city has been selected to perform at the showcase in Orlando next year.
Selected participants will perform for American talent scout Kim Meyers and a room full of model, music and acting agents, in hopes of achieving success like Port Elizabeth-born Arts alumni Gino Lee who received 18 call backs and a prestigious scholarship at the New York Film Academy.
Angelique Adcock,45, will perform a monologue, and her daughter Skye, 15, will model while Zukiswa Mankunzi, 44, and her daughter, Yanela, 17, have both been selected to showcase their modelling talents.
Before being selected for Arts, Angelique put her aspirations of being in the entertainment industry on hold. The family business owner and online radio presenter has dreamt of being an actress since age five when she first started acting in school productions.
“I’ve been dreaming about my dream for 40 years, and just decided to take action and go for my dream,” said Angelique.
And Zukiswa Mankunzi was spurred on by Angelique’s decision to audition herself. Zukiswa said that she initially wanted her daughter to audition, but when she saw Angelique she realised that it wasn’t just for the youth.
“You can do this!” she told herself.
Zukiswa, a gospel music singer songwriter from Motherwell, hopes that the showcase will afford her the opportunity to record her CD.
“The end result for me is to record my CD. If I can do that internationally that would be amazing but the most important thing is to learn and bring something back to SA,” said Zukiswa.
Like their mothers, Skye and Yanela also hope that their participation in the showcase will help them achieve international success.
Yanela, who recently won the title of Extreme Model’s Miss Runway for 2017, hopes that she can spread the message that “it’s fine whether your big or small, you can still be part of the modelling industry”.
Skye in turn wants Bay talents to know that “even if you think that you’re not tall enough you can still do commercial modelling and you will still be able to do photographic modelling, so just go for it”.
The Adcocks and Mankunzis are not the only success stories from Port Elizabeth who hope to attend Arts in Florida next year, from July 23 to 29.   Although she did not know them all, Angelique said they included Khumo Makapela, Denzil Booysen, Asande Mchunu, Magdalene Chaponda, Siphoshile Blanket, Khazimla Kondlo, Charlize Visser and Robynn Jacobs.
