Accolade affirms impact on lives of less fortunate
A Port Elizabeth skills training centre has been singled out for the positive contribution it makes to the lives of the less fortunate.
Winning the highest accolade, a gold award – and R25 000 – at the Impumelelo Social Innovations Award at the weekend, was the Ray Mhlaba Skills Training Centre in Glendinningvale.
Centre project director, Caroline Ferreira, said her staff were thrilled about the award and what it might hold for the future.
The money would be used to market the centre and attract new investors, she said.
“The ripple effect of this award is most important and it will be so incredible for the centre,” Ferreira said.
“We were nominated by one of the Impumelelo employees who previously visited our centre.”
The centre provides a wide array of training services to vulnerable young people between the ages of 18 and 25, with most of the trainees coming from children’s homes, child-headed homes or homes where no family member has an income.
Courses offered include sewing, hairdressing, hospitality, woodwork and upholstery.


“We are so grateful to everyone who has helped us on our journey so far and in the bigger picture, this award is for everyone involved in the programme,” Ferreira said.
The Impumelelo Awards is held every year to acknowledge the hard work of individuals and organisations that make it their mission to improve the lives of South Africans.
The awards programme is based on rigorous evaluations with the end goal of promoting public and private partnerships. Speaking about the awards evening, Ferreira said about 800 people were hosted at The Artscape Opera House in Cape Town.
“It was so wonderful to be in the presence of vibrant young people who were full of energy, despite coming from a poor background and disadvantaged areas.,” she said.
“We have 12 of our students working at leading hotels in Cape Town and for them to be there and be part of the event was such an eye-opener.”
HCI Foundation general manager Carol van der Rheede, who sat on the panel of judges, said the Ray Mhlaba centre was a very deserving recipient of the award.
“What makes them special is that they offer a high job absorption rate and the difference they are making in the lives of these kids,” she said.
“The fact that they received the award elevates them as an organisation. It is a big thing that they put their students into jobs, which not only helps them but also their families.”
