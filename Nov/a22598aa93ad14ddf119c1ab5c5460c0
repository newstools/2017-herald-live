PE side’s giant-killing ways stopped abruptly with quarterfinal defeat
Chippa United’s giant- killing ways came to an abrupt end when they were beaten 1-0 by Kaizer Chiefs in their Telkom Knockout Cup quarterfinal soccer clash at a packed Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth yesterday.
A first-half Bernard Parker penalty ensured the AmaKhosi reached the semifinals of the competition, much to the delight of their vociferous fans, who made up the majority of the 31288 crowd.
Chiefs now play Bidvest Wits in the one semifinal while Polokwane City will face Bloemfontein Celtic in the other, with the first of the two-legged ties to be played on November 18 and 19.
From a Chippa perspective, the defeat means the Chilli Boys’ unbeaten run under caretaker coach Teboho Moloi, which lasted eight matches, has come to an end.
There was confidence within the Chippa camp that they could pull off another big win, especially considering their most recent victories over former African champions Mamelodi Sundowns and defending PSL champions Wits.
But it was not to be, as the Glamour Boys turned on the charm to produce a match-winning performance after absorbing some early pressure from the home team.
Kaizer Chiefs made a statement as early as the fourth minute, when Siphiwe Tshabalala found the Chippa net, only for Parker to be ruled offside.
The Chilli Boys then controlled the next 20 minutes and had a number of chances to take the lead.
The first came in the sixth minute, but Mpho Mvelase could only manage a tame shot with only goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune to beat.
Two minutes later, Andile Mbenyane had probably their best chance of the half. Khune clashed with his defender Eric Mathoho and the ball fell favourably for Mbenyane, who shot wide of a gaping goalmouth.
Mathoho was on hand to save Chiefs in the 20th minute when he blocked an on-target shot from Paseka Mako.
A shoulder in the box charge from Chippa defender James Okwuosa resulted in a penalty in the 30th minute, which Parker struck exquisitely, sending Daniel Akpeyi the wrong way to put his side one up.
The visitors applied more pressure towards the end of the first half but missed an opportunity to make it two when Parker’s shot went wide.
The second half got off to an electrifying start with both teams using their chances effectively on the counterattack.
The introduction of speedy Kurt Lentjies and in-form Samuel Julies in the 51st minute brought about more pace to the game and the home side looked to be finding their rhythm.
They started attacking the Soweto giants from the flanks, using the effective combination of Lentjies and Mvelase.
Julies was yet again in top form, piling on the pressure upfront but the Chiefs stood firm.
The match had a bitter ending when Chiefs goalkeeper Khune collided with Lentjies and both had to be stretchered off the field.
