Project team need help to grow and develop sport in Motherwell
The Wembley Tennis Club and Breakpoint Tennis Academy have joined forces to assist in the growth of tennis in Motherwell.
The Wembley Breakpoint Motherwell Development Initiative (WBMDI) will take place once a month at Wembley, with juniors and coaches under the supervision of the Break Point Tennis Academy receiving tuition in two-hour sessions.
Besides the on-court programme, Wembley will assist with facilities and structuring of the Motherwell Tennis Club, which will include revamping of existing courts, building an extra court and possibly a clubhouse.
“The purpose of the initiative is the sourcing of sponsorship, facilities refurbishment and a junior development plan to uplift the Motherwell Tennis Club over the next three years,” Wembley chairman Gavin Cullen said.
“The initiative is aimed at promoting a sustainable development for the Motherwell Tennis Club.
“We are looking for financial assistance in this project and anyone able to help can contact me at 079-528-4444.”
There are two coaches who oversee all operations of the Motherwell club – Babalo Burwana and Xolile Poswa. The club is situated at the Raymond Mhlaba Sports Centre.
For four to five years, tennis development took place in Motherwell, using an open basketball court.
During this time, the coaches had only one junior in the EP U14 boys’ team. Since moving to the Raymond Mhlaba Sports Centre, there have been five players competitive at a provincial level. Burwana, himself, represented EP from U10 to U16.
The coaches have now developed 15 junior players, but the numbers are dropping due to various reasons, including the lack of funds.


Wembley have developed into one of the leading clubs in Port Elizabeth in recent years and are hoping the strength of their membership can help the growth of tennis in Motherwell.
Breakpoint Tennis Academy, under director Richard Bulbring, will supervise every aspect of the player development programme, starting from beginner level with all junior players.
After two sessions the group will be assessed, with the most advanced and passionate players being invited to Breakpoint Tennis Academy holiday camps, where the best juniors will be exposed to high-level development for rapid growth.
Players within the Motherwell Tennis Club will be given extra training in the week at Motherwell and will be sponsored. Recreational tennis at the Motherwell Tennis Club will be promoted through schools and the community, with games being played once a week at the club to create interest.
Players at junior tennis tournaments will be assessed throughout the year.
Juniors who are deemed of a suitable standard will be approved by Breakpoint Tennis Academy and from there the academy will be with them every step of the way.
Breakpoint will also supervise and develop Motherwell coaches to carry out coaching programmes provided by the academy.
“By combining our resources in this way, we will provide better opportunities to source funding from lotto, private and public companies and various tennis associations,” Cullen said.
“We will start by uplifting the Motherwell Tennis Club and we eventually want both clubs to grow together.”
