Baxter insists he could work around goalie’s absence ahead of Senegal clash
He is not losing sleep over the possibility that goalkeeper Itumeleng Khune may miss the clash against Senegal at the Peter Mokaba Stadium in Polokwane on Friday, says Bafana Bafana coach Stuart Baxter.
Khune could miss the match, because he has a bone fracture in his face after colliding with Chippa United’s Kurt Lentjies in Sunday’s Telkom Knockout quarterfinals clash won 1-0 by Chiefs.
Khune was to see a specialist to determine the extent of the injury.
Baxter insisted that he could work around Khune’s absence, even though the last time the latter missed the two games against Cape Verde due to injury, Bafana lost both encounters 2-1 home and away, which has put them on the back foot as the bottom side in Group D.
“I will be honest; I don’t think in terms of that. You’ve got to believe in your players,” Baxter, who has two keepers Wayne Sandilands and Ronwen Williams, in camp, said.
Sandilands and Williams played one game each against Cape Verde, before Khune returned in the 3-1 win over Burkina Faso recently.
Baxter continued: “The players also have to believe in themselves, whoever plays is picked because he can do the job.”
Meanwhile, Baxter could not hide his frustration at the fact that five overseas-based players were yet to report for camp.
Thulani Serero, Andile Jali, Lebogang Manyama, Keagan Dolly and Dino Ndlovu have either had their flights delayed or cancelled. Bongani Zungu is in camp even though he will miss Friday’s encounter because of a one-match suspension.
Baxter said he hoped there could be a solution to this challenge as it was not new.
“I think this is probably normal and you get used to it, but I always like things to be smoother than this.


“We have to get players in from Europe as quickly as possible and until I get everyone in camp, it’s difficult to be comfortable.
“I think there are two things that have got to be sharpened up and one, the players have to be proactive in terms of making sure that they get to camp on time.
“Two, the association also has to be proactive in contact with their clubs, booking tickets and making sure people know well in advance.
“I think it would be very nice if we could take away this constant frustration of not having everyone on time and I’m not accusing anyone of anything, but that’s a challenge that South African football has and maybe Senegal has the same thing, I don’t know.”
Bafana had an afternoon training yesterday at the match venue. In total, there were 16 players.
Kaizer Chiefs duo Siphiwe Tshabalala and Mulomowandau Mathoho are expected to arrive today after their club’s 1-0 win over Chippa United on Sunday in Port Elizabeth.
Meanwhile, Bafana have been promised huge support for the qualifier on Friday.
Bafana take on the Lions of Teranga at the 45 000-seater Peter Mokaba Stadium (7pm), with tickets selling for just R30.
Polokwane mayor Thembi Nkadimeng was quick to assure the team that they would have enough support on Friday.
“To the coach and your team, this is Polokwane municipality and you know our hospitality, our love, our support and we have pulled out all the stops to ensure that this one is also a spectacle,” Nkadimeng said.
