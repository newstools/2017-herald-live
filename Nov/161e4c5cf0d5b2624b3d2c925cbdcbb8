If the Southern Kings want to step up to the next level they must improve their basic skills which are letting them down at crucial times, says head coach Deon Davids.
That was Davids’s verdict after his team’s 43-36 PRO14 defeat against Ulster in a 12-try bonanza at the Wolfson Stadium on Saturday.
At one stage, the Kings, who led 22-10 at half time, looked to be heading for their first win of the season in front of a lively crowd of 2836 in Kwazakhele.
There had been hopes that a switch of venue from the 46000-seater Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium would give the Kings some added home-ground advantage, and at one stage it looked like the move was working its magic.
Ulster, however, staged a stirring second-half fightback in a game that kept the crowd on the edge of their seats and produced sparkling tries.
The victory moved Ulster up to second place in Conference B, while the winless Kings remain bottom of the log after an eighth successive defeat.
“We had an in-depth team talk after the game,” Davids said.
“In general, I don’t think this is a game that Ulster won, but I think it is game that we actually lost. There was a lot of good stuff.
“But to be competitive and to make that step up to the next level there are things that are crucially important. The one thing we need to work on is our fundamental skills.
“We must ensure that every kick, pass and catch is sound.
Those are the things that distinguish you from being average to taking you to the next level.
“The Kings did so much good stuff, like scoring tries, but immediately afterwards we just conceded a try. When you have that shift in momentum consistently you allow the opposition to come back easily.
“I felt that at the start of the game there were opportunities where we could have buried them and made them play catch-up rugby. However, we squandered some.
Davids said he was pleased that his team was turning territorial advantage into points.
“It was good to see that when we got into the opposition 22 we converted that advantage into points. There was a stage in the game where we did not play enough rugby in the Ulster 22.
“We were not patient enough to look after the ball and build the phases so that we could be clinical in our execution.
“But I am not going to sit here and be negative because I think that is the wrong mindset. I think we are making strides in the right direction.
“There are a couple of youngsters, who made their debuts, who are really putting their hands up.
“Wing Michael Makase showed some good pace in the try that he scored.
“I also think fullback Yaw Penxe was outstanding in terms of the high ball and he brought a different dimension to our attack from turnover ball.
“So there are lots of positives to work on going forward. We need to be careful not to sit here and make excuses and be happy with where we are.”
The Kings now have a three-week break before their next home game, against Welsh outfit Scarlets on November 26.
It has not been decided whether that game will be played at the Wolfson Stadium or the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium.
Points scorers:
Southern Kings 36: Tries: Berton Klaasen (2), Yaw Penxe (2), Michael Makase. Conversions: Oliver Zono (4). Penalty: Zono (1).
Ulster 43: Tries: Sean Reidy, John Andrew (2), John Cooney, Andrew Trimble, Clive Hall, Robbie Diack. Conversions: Cooney (1), Christian Lealiifano (3).
