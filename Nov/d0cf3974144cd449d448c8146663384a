But we cannot guarantee 2019 World Cup squad places, says Proteas coach
Morne Morkel has pledged his future to the Proteas for the next few years but coach Ottis Gibson cannot guarantee the 33-year old fast bowler a place in the 2019 World Cup squad.

Morkel‚ who has played in 79 tests‚ 112 ODIs and 44 T20s for the Proteas over 11 years‚ said last month he needed clarity from Gibson on his short- and long-term future, because age was not on his side.
“Yes‚ I have had discussions with him [Morkel] and he is committed to the Proteas for the next couple of years‚” Gibson said.
“Obviously, the World Cup is big, but we can’t run away from the fact that there can’t be any guarantees with regards to that.”
Morkel broke down with a side strain on the fourth day of the first test against Bangladesh in Potchefstroom last month and Gibson said selection for the 2019 World Cup in England would depend largely on fitness.
“It will be about form‚ fitness and conditions that we are going to find in England‚” he said.
“But we have had an honest discussion and Morkel has committed his future to us for the next few years.”
When he left the test pitch injured‚ Morkel joined fellow fast bowlers Dale Steyn and Vernon Philander and all-rounder Chris Morris on the injury list.
But they are likely to be available for the start of the CSA T20 Challenge in two weeks’ time.
Speaking with specific reference to Steyn‚ Gibson said he would get the nod in the four-day test against Zimbabwe on Boxing Day in Port Elizabeth, if his injury did not recur during the domestic T20 Challenge – from November 10 to December 17.


“Steyn has a lot of T20 cricket to play and we have a lot of time to manage his load to ensure that he is 100% fit”, Gibson said.
“It is Dale Steyn we are talking about‚ not some average guy from down the road‚ but one of the best fast bowlers this country has ever produced.
“If you look him in the eye and he says he can make it, then he will be given the opportunity.”
Gibson‚ who is returning to England for a few weeks today‚ said he had enjoyed working on his first assignment as the head coach of the Proteas – in which they had convincingly whitewashed Bangladesh in the tests‚ ODIs and T20s series.
“It has gone very well and we played good cricket,” he said.
“There is a lot that was said about the opposition, but we played dominant cricket.
“Over the course of the past five weeks, we also used some new domestic talent – in Aiden Markram in the test and ODI series‚ and Wium Mulder – which has been pleasing.” BANGLADESH’S cricket board will launch an investigation into its humiliating drubbing during a recent tour of South Africa in one of its worst performances on record.
Bangladesh lost every match in all three formats, with the Proteas’ David Miller smashing the fastest century in Twenty20 history off just 35 balls from the hapless visitors.
Bangladesh Cricket Board president Nazmul Hasan said the players, managers and coaching staff would be questioned over the woeful showing.
“The overall performance was very bad. Of course, we have some questions,” Hasan said in Dhaka.
“We have to know if there were other problems. We all know Bangladesh can lose games, but we cannot accept the way they lost them.”
Their bowlers, who were lacklustre throughout the tour, were not all to blame as the batsmen “could not do anything even on a flat wicket”, Hasan said.
Bangladesh only attained test status in 2000, and rank ninth on the international ladder, but have enjoyed some recent wins at home over Australia, Sri Lanka and England.
But their drubbing abroad has highlighted the bigger challenge for the cricket minnows, Hasan said.
Bangladesh are due to host Sri Lanka in January in their next series, before travelling to the West Indies. – AFP
