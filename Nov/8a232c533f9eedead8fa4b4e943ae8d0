Judgment due tomorrow after Price blasts ‘dirty case’. Follow The Herald for live updates. 
Tomorrow marks murder-accused Christopher Panayiotou’s 31st birthday, and whether or not it will be cause to celebrate now lies in the hands of the Port Elizabeth High Court, with Judge Dayalin Chetty due to deliver his verdict.

Closing arguments from lawyers representing Panayiotou, alleged hitman Sinethemba Nemembe and co-conspirator Zolani Sibeko took up much of the day yesterday.
Defence Advocate Terry Price SC and attorney Peter Daubermann called for their respective clients to be acquitted, but set out to attack the state’s case from entirely different angles.
While Price moved to discredit the state’s witnesses and associates, Daubermann said he had not called Nemembe and Sibeko to testify in their own defence because there was absolutely no case for them to answer to.
Daubermann said this was particularly so with Sibeko, who was not even – on the state’s own version – at the scene of the crime when Jayde Panayiotou, 29, was kidnapped and shot dead, allegedly at the behest of her husband, on April 21 2015.
Price, meanwhile, did not hold back on his criticism of state advocate Marius Stander, investigating officer Captain Kanna Swanepoel, lawyers Johan van der Spuy and Ryno Scholtz, or Colonel Willie Mayi, of the SAPS.
He said Swanepoel was a serial liar who should be jailed, while Mayi, who arrested self-confessed middleman Luthando Siyoni, and allegedly tortured him into confessing, was an enforcer and serial “beater upper”.


Price also highlighted what he described as the unprofessional conduct of Legal Aid Advocate Van der Spuy, who represented Siyoni at the time of him becoming a Section 204 witness, and attorney Scholtz, who later took over from Van der Spuy.
He said Van der Spuy did not even take the time to explain to Siyoni the meaning and implications of being a Section 204 witness.
Referring to Scholtz, with whom Price has worked on numerous criminal matters in the past, he said Scholtz had simply left Siyoni in the lurch because he was friends with Stander and Swanepoel.
He said Scholtz had then destroyed the recordings he had made of his consultations with Siyoni.
“I don’t think the Cape Law Society will take very kindly to their conduct,” he said.
“In my many years in law . . . I have never seen a more dirty case.
“The state is supposed to come to court with clean hands, instead they came in muddy from top to toe.
“It is terrible to acquit a guilty person but a person’s rights cannot be trampled on. We can’t allow the cops to do as they please.”
Daubermann, meanwhile, said the only thing that linked Sibeko to Nemembe and deceased alleged triggerman Sizwezakhe Vumazonke was a cellphone that was not even found in his possession.
The phone’s cellphone billing shows its user communicated with the parties in the days leading up to the Uitenhage teacher’s murder, and placed the handset at the Panayiotous’ Kabega Park home, as well as in the vicinity of Jayde’s close friend, Cherise Swanepoel, with whom she carpooled to work.
The same handset was not in the vicinity of Jayde’s home on the day she was kidnapped, nor was it placed at the scene of the shooting in KwaNobuhle.
When it came to Nemembe, Daubermann said there was not even an insinuation from the prosecution that he was the one who forced Jayde into the car, or later pulled the trigger.
Judgment is expected tomorrow.
