Elation as SA likely to host 2023 rugby tournament
South Africa’s bid to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup moved one step closer to reality yesterday when the country was named the preferred host candidate – news greeted with elation in Nelson Mandela Bay.
In the sweltering heat of a stuffy conference room at parliament, however‚ Sports Minister Thulas Nxesi and SA Rugby president Mark Alexander and chief executive Jurie Roux looked more relieved than elated.
There is still one more hurdle to clear – the official vote on November 15 – and although it should be a mere formality‚ there was an air of caution after South Africa’s bid was deemed the best submitted to an independent bid evaluation committee on June 1.
That prudent approach, however, did not deter Bay officials and the metro’s hospitality industry from expressing their excitement over the potential economic impact.
It has been estimated that hosting the tournament would produce major benefits for South Africa, with a forecast of R27-billion in direct, indirect and induced economic impact.

It is estimated that R5.7-billion of that would flow to low-income households, while 38 600 temporary or permanent jobs would be sustained with an estimated R1.4-billion direct tax benefit to the government.
The 827-page‚ 8.2kg bid book scored 79% against the committee’s six weighted criteria.
France was second on 76% and Ireland third with 72%.
“Based on the evaluation contained in this report‚ the candidate that scored the highest marks and is therefore deemed to be the optimal candidate to host Rugby World Cup 2023 is South Africa‚” the report said.
“It is the recommendation of the RWCL board of directors to [the] World Rugby Council that South Africa should be awarded the right to host Rugby World Cup 2023.”
In theory, South Africans should start celebrating, but even though everything has been done to ensure voting is transparent and untainted‚ the country needs at least 20 of the 39 World Rugby Council votes to ratify the evaluation committee’s recommendation.
World Rugby‚ by embarking on a transparent bidding process‚ has all but ensured that when its members’ council votes in a little more than two weeks‚ South Africa’s bid will be ratified.
One of the major reasons why South Africa submitted a bid for the fourth consecutive time was that the bidding criteria were changed to eliminate the threat of horse-trading when votes are cast.
“This was a rigorous and objective process which we have supported from day one and we thank World Rugby for instituting a process that took lobbying out of the equation and professionally identified which host would deliver the best tournament for players‚ fans and the game‚” Roux said.
Ireland, though, has vowed to continue the fight until voting day‚ although it is unclear what more it can do to change the outcome.
“There is nothing in the report which is insurmountable and this is certainly not the end of the road‚” Ireland bid chairman Dick Spring said.
“We absolutely believe Ireland can secure the tournament for 2023.”
SA Rugby’s Alexander believes the council will do the right thing by simply rubber-stamping an independent recommendation that cost World Rugby more than R8-million to produce.
“What is the point if the council doesn’t vote according to the outcome?” he said.


“Then we are no further along than we were years ago and all that money spent on this evaluation would have been a waste.”
Nxesi said celebrations would have to wait until it became official that South Africa was the host.
“We have to celebrate this first step and it’s a great and historic day for the SA nation‚ for sport and for rugby‚ but remember we have not actually won the bid yet,” he said.
World Rugby chairman Bill Beaumont said: “The comprehensive and independently scrutinised evaluation reaffirmed that we have three exceptional bids, but it identified South Africa as a clear leader based on performance against the key criteria.”
The Mandela Bay Development Agency (MBDA), as the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium management, said it was extremely excited about the positive impact the tournament would have on the city and the Eastern Cape.
Spokesman Luvuyo Bangazi said although there were still a few steps to go, the agency looked forward to evaluating the economic impact.
“As a newer stadium, we have scheduled maintenance taking place periodically before then with no major or huge capital costs going forward,” he said.
“We have been very thorough with budgeting with plans in advance.”
Mayoral spokesman Sibongile Dimbaza said events such as the Rugby World Cup were a big drawcard for the Bay because of the sustainable economic benefits for the host cities.
“Hotels and other establishments are always fully booked and that is great for tourism and the local economy,” he said.


“[And] the international coverage would go a long way in positioning our city in terms of its beauty and tourism offerings.
“The Soccer World Cup in 2010 gave the international community a glimpse of what this country is capable of. ”
Nelson Mandela Bay Tourism manager Titus Chuene said the organisation was excited about welcoming tourists to the Bay.
“People travel for experiences, not to sleep in hotels, and rugby is an experience which will definitely bring people to the Bay,” he said.
Port Elizabeth Metro Bed and Breakfast Association chairwoman Shena Wilmot said it was very exciting news for the accommodation industry.


“All these big events are phenomenal for us – it is exactly what we need.
“We see a lot of tourists with sporting events.
“We are 100% behind the bid and hope and pray we get selected.”
Angus MacMillan, spokesman for the City Lodge Hotel Group, which has five hotels in the city, said the group was cautiously optimistic and excited.
“It [the Rugby World Cup] is very important as it brings first-time visitors who may become repeat visitors and acts as a great advertising tool for [their] family and friends back home.
“There is also great access to the rest of the Eastern Cape and Garden Route for visitors.”
