Chippa United will hit the reset button and refocus after the loss to Kaizer Chiefs in the Telkom Knockout cup quarterfinals, caretaker coach Teboho Moloi said.
He was speaking after his charges suffered a 1-0 loss to the Soweto Giants in a nail-biting game at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth on Sunday.
The defeat was the end of an eight-match unbeaten run for Moloi since taking over from Dan Malesela, but the mentor is taking the positives out of the match.
“It was a great game for us and our supporters came out in numbers and were entertained thoroughly by the two teams, ” Moloi said.
“Steve [Komphela] did very well in the first half and he managed to reinforced his defence in the second half to protect their lead, which made it hard for us to penetrate for an equaliser.”
“It is time for them [Chippa players] to dust themselves off and soldier on. Losing is part of football and we should accept it.”
Despite being in top goal-scoring form from off the bench for the Chilli Boys in the team’s previous two matches, Samuel Julies did not make the starting lineup again.
Instead, he came on for Lerato Manzini in the 51st minute and shook the Amakhosi’s defence.
“We introduced Julies and Kurt Lentjies in the second half and we tried everything, but it was not to be for the boys,” Moloi said.
“Julies changed that game and forced Steve Komphela to reinforce his defence.
“That was a clear sign to us that we were possibly on our way to an equaliser.


“Julies is one of the most influential players and I know most teams base their defensive tactics around him,” the coach said.
Moloi urged his players to pick themselves up and focus on the upcoming games. “Decisions tend to differ from game to game and I have often experienced that,” he said.
“We could have shown a bit more maturity in the second half when decisions were not going our way.
“We should have carried on and not have tempers flaring, which is something we also need to work on as a team.”
The soft-spoken coach has set his sights on bigger things in the Premier Soccer League and the Nedbank Cup.
“The most important competition that we want is the Nedbank Cup,” he said. “I want to start working with the movement of the players going forward.
“But it is also important that the boys take time to reflect on the loss and how we can pick up our spirits,” Moloi said.
“We want to snap out this transit so that when the league starts again, we can still find our rhythm.”
Chippa have time off in an international break, and will only return to PSL action when they play Free State Stars on November 22.
“We also want to come up with enterprising ways to break down teams with reinforced defences,” Maloi said.
“So, there is still a lot of work to be done, because we want to compete with the best.”
