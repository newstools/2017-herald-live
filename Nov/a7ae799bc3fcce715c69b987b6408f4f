 Social workers at Livingstone Hospital are looking for the families of the following patients:
*An unknown man who arrived at the hospital on October 17. Social worker Natasha Meyer said the man cannot speak properly. “We don’t know his name or where he stays. Nobody is visiting him.  He is in his late 40s.” Meyer said.

Anybody who knows this man or his family can contact Meyer on 041 405 2129 or 0783492074.
*A patient who was admitted to the Accident and Emergency Unit at the hospital on October 29 after he was assaulted two days earlier.
“He is very weak and confused and unable to communicate well,” social worker Lamees Majiet said.
“He claims to live in Extension 36 in Bethelsdorp and that he has family in that area but he can’t give us a street name, contact details or names of family members. He claims his name is Booi Vaaltyn and he looks like he is in his late 50s or 60s.

Anybody who knows this man or his family can phone Majiet on 041 405 2576 or 041 405 2609.
