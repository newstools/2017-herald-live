Johan Oosthuizen of Fuel on Wheels will cycle in honour of Jayde Panayiotou’s birthday next weekPicture: Supplied
Even after death, Jayde Panayiotou has touched the lives of people who never even met her – so much so that a local resident who claims he does not have the body for cycling will spend 24 hours on his bike in honour of the murdered teacher’s 32nd birthday.
Jayde would have celebrated her birthday on Wednesday next week.
Johan Oosthuizen, founding member of charity organisation Fuel on Wheels, plans to kick off the awareness campaign and fundraiser by climbing on his bike at 6am on Tuesday.
He will then continuously cycle the 5km block around his Aalwyn Street, Uitenhage, home until 6am the following day.
Oosthuizen, 40, said while he had not known the Uitenhage teacher, his wife had been friendly with Jayde.
“After her murder, I got to know the Inggs family and they are the most wonderful people I have ever met.”
He said charity had always been close to his heart.
Oosthuizen helped launch Fuel on Wheels two years ago, a project initially set up to raise funds for wheelchairs.
From there, they began collecting food for underprivileged schools in the Uitenhage area.


“I then began reading about Jayde and she really grabbed my attention. I wanted to raise awareness in her honour,” he said.
“She was just so full of life. Every time I visited the Inggs farm, I learnt another fascinating fact about her.”
And that was just one of the reasons Oosthuizen decided to call his latest venture “Let’s Live for Jayde”.
He said a tent would be set up outside his house with live music and other entertainment. A braai would also be on the go.
He said 1 000 people had already shown interest in attending the event.
“Jayde was very involved with animals, so the beneficiary will be the Uitenhage SPCA.”
Those attending are encouraged to bring a tin of dog food or R10 towards the cause.
“We would also like to encourage those with bikes to cycle alongside me for a couple of laps.”
Oosthuizen joked that he used his body as a selling tool.
“People look at me and don’t think I can do it. It’s all the encouragement I need to prove them wrong.”
