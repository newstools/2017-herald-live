Southern Kings practise at Kwazakhele’s Wolfson StadiumFile picture: Werner Hills
Visiting European PRO14 teams must be hauled out of their comfort zone and taken to the township streets when they play matches in Port Elizabeth, Southern Kings skipper Schalk Ferreira said.
The burly prop was talking after the Southern Kings were beaten 43-36 in a pulsating showdown in front of a lively crowd of 2 836 fans at the compact Wolfson Stadium in Kwazakhele.
“It was really good playing at the Wolfson Stadium,” Ferreira said.
“When the Kings go and play in Europe, we go to places like Connacht in Ireland where the conditions, to be honest, are horrible.
“We will give them some of the same music here.
“This is our comfort zone and we will take them to the streets and bring them to the township, where we can connect with the people and put them out of their comfort zones,” the skipper said.
Kings head coach Deon Davids said he would like to see more matches played in Kwazakhele.
“If the stadium had been packed, it would have been a great atmosphere to play rugby in.
“We would like to see this happen more and the team enjoy this.
“There is a bit of closeness playing here in Kwazakhele and I enjoyed the singing of the crowd and people getting involved,” Davids said. “That is what rugby is about.”
Ulster coach Les Kiss said his team had expected a tough battle against the Kings after it was decided to switch the match from the 46 000-seater Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium to Kwazakhele.
“We knew in the build-up that the Kings would be lifting themselves to another performance level and that came to bear,” Kiss said.


“When the venue switch was first mooted, we were a bit concerned – what it would mean and what advantage it would give to the Kings.
“We had to stand tall, because it is a massive advantage for the Kings to come to Kwazakhele.
“You cannot blame them for choosing this ground and finding a real good energy in their game.
“They are only going to get better and if they bring more games here [Wolfson] it will be tough.”
Ulster captain Chris Henry said the week spent in Port Elizabeth was the most enjoyable time he had experienced in an Ulster shirt.
“It has been an amazing time and the experience of playing at the Wolfson Stadium,” Henry said.
“Playing here was history and this group of players will probably not get a chance like this again.
“I can honestly say it is the best experience I have had in an Ulster shirt.”
Meanwhile, Kings hooker Micheal Willemse is expected to be out of action for two months with a tear in a groin muscle.
Kings team doctor Clement Plaatjies said scrumhalf Rudi van Rooyen, who was stretchered off the field during the clash against Ulster, was suffering from a concussion.
