Hospital gynaecology head denies assault claims
A complaint has been laid with police against a well-known Port Elizabeth doctor in connection with an alleged assault on a teenager at a church function at the weekend.
Abongile Bulo, 16, said she was with her sister and a friend when Dr Mfundo Mabenge, who heads Dora Nginza Hospital’s gynaecology and obstetrics department, allegedly assaulted her.
Mabenge has denied the allegations.
Abongile’s parents took her to the Humewood police station to lay an assault complaint following the alleged incident, which the family claimed took place at lunchtime on Saturday.
Abongile alleged that Mabenge slapped her face, followed her when she ran away from him and then punched her in front of her mother.
However, Mabenge insisted yesterday that he had not touched Abongile and had only chastised her as she and friends were making a noise during the church service.
Abongile was with her mother, Koliswa Hoyi, 45, and sister, Okuhle Bulo, 20, at the Seventh Day Adventist Church service held at the Women’s Club in Summerstrand when the alleged assault occurred.
“I was sitting with my sister and a friend just chilling and chatting before lunch was served, when he came up to us and started shouting, saying we were making a noise in church and being silly,” Abongile said.
“I tried to lean back, but he pointed his finger in my face and then slapped me,” she alleged.
Okuhle said Mabenge, who is also a specialist gynaecological oncologist, had lambasted the siblings “for being silly and talking in church”.
“He then started pointing his finger in Abongile’s face before slapping her in a downward motion,” she said.
“I really didn’t expect that kind of thing to happen in a church.”
Abongile said she had tried to run to the bathroom, but Mabenge followed her and allegedly punched her in front of her mother.
“He even pulled down my wig,” she said.
Hoyi said she was so stunned that she did not know how to react.
“He did this in front of me,” she said.


“I asked him, ‘Why are you beating my child?’ and he [allegedly] said, ‘I am going to beat her again’.”
Abongile said a number of people had asked afterwards what was going on, but she had felt so embarrassed that she and her family had left.
Zovuyo Mosojola, 20, of Summerstrand, who was with the sisters at the time, said she was shocked by the alleged incident.
“He [Mabenge] came up to them [Abongile and Okuhle] and started shouting at them, telling them that they were naughty in church.
“He hit Abongile in the face,” Mosojola alleged.
“It was completely unexpected and I was so stunned.”
Another witness, who asked not to be named, said: “I was shocked, I didn’t know what he was talking about.
“When Abongile asked what she had done, he said she was naughty and talking in church.
“He was pointing his finger in her face and hit her,” she alleged.
After leaving the venue, the three women went home to Coega Village to tell Abongile’s stepfather, Mzi, 47, what had happened.
They then went to the Humewood police station to report the matter.
“I am furious. We are not going to back down, he must pay for this,” Hoyi said.
Mabenge said: “There was no assault.
“These young girls are always disruptive, so I cautioned them.” He declined to comment further. The church’s district pastor, MM Sojola, said he had heard an incident had taken place but was waiting for more details.
“We have protocols in the church and this matter will be discussed internally,” he said.
Police spokesman Warrant Officer Alwin Labans confirmed that an assault complaint had been laid at the Humewood police station and was being investigated.
