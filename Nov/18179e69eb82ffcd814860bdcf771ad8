More than 4000 adults in Nelson Mandela Bay were diagnosed with diabetes between April last year and September this yearPicture: www.pexels.co.za
Health officials are worried about the number of undiagnosed diabetics in Nelson Mandela Bay, as the metro has the lowest screening rate in the Eastern Cape.
Yesterday, a day ahead of World Diabetes Day – being marked today – health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said despite the low screening rate there were 1 949 new adult cases of the disease diagnosed in the metro between April last year and March this year, and a further 2 289 between April and September this year.
Over and above this, 142 children were also diagnosed with diabetes.
Kupelo said more than 50 000 visits to clinics and hospitals in the metro were necessitated by diabetes, and medication to treat it cost the department close to R10-million a year.
He said the need to include patients younger than 40 in routine screening was being made a priority.
Novartis South Africa medical director and chief scientific officer Dr Nicola Lister said diabetes was one of the leading causes of death among women in South Africa, yet it was entirely preventable.


She said: “Up to 70% of cases of type 2 diabetes could be prevented.
“Women and girls are the focus of this year’s World Diabetes Day.”
She said it was important to be screened, as early detection allowed for improved management.
In the recently published Discovery Vitality ObeCity Index, Port Elizabeth was revealed as the city with the least people with a healthy weight – just 48.81% fell into this category.
Diabetes medical adviser at Lilly South Africa, Dr Ntsiki Molefe-Osman, said diabetes was a serious disease and could have serious complications including eye disease, nerve damage, kidney disease and a high risk of foot and leg amputations.

The Woolworths Education programme is offering parents in Port Elizabeth a store tour and information session with dieticians to assist them in making healthy food choices for themselves and their family. The tour will be tonight at 7pm at the Walmer Park Woolworths store and will run for about two hours.
