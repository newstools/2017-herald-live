Gardens players celebrate their Mayoral Cup success after beating Spring Rose at the Wolfson Stadium

Gardens sealed their rugby season with another trophy when they were crowned this year’s Mayoral Cup champions after thrashing Spring Rose 40-17 at the Wolfson Stadium in Kwazakhele on Sunday.
The Uitenhage side have had a fine season, banking the EPRU Super 12 competition earlier this year and then falling just short in the playoffs of the Grand Challenge Cup.
They had an impressive record in the Mayoral Cup, with three back-to-back victories over Despatch, Progress and Spring Rose.
Their depth in the bench assisted them to conquer all their opponents with ease.
Spring Rose were outplayed in the final match on Sunday.
In the women’s division of the competition, the Kwaru team retained their title when they beat African Bombers 20-10.


The four tries from the Kwazakhele team were enough to crush the African Bombers.
Both teams had been equally dominant in the tournament and it went down to which team wanted the crown the most.
Kwaru had upstaged Moonlight in their opening encounter but were recently beaten in the national club rugby competition in Cape Town.
African Bombers had been chalking up high scores from the outset of the competition, thumping Moonlight 78-10 and beating Star of Hope 78-15.
Meanwhile, in the men’s sub divisions of the tournament, Hilltop Eagles managed to outplay Kuyga, just edging them 39-25.
Glen Roses beat Uitenhage 34-12 and St Marks were involved in a low-scoring game against Siyakhula, edging them 13-8.
