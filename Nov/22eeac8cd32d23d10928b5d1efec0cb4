 The SA Football Association (Safa) has failed to have the suspension of Bafana Bafana midfielder Bongani Zungu overturned by Fifa.
Less than 24 hours after Safa had said Fifa had kept it waiting on its bid to have Zungu’s red card overturned ‚ it made an about-turn at the weekend and said it had in fact been informed that Zungu remained suspended for Bafana’s home game against Senegal in Polokwane on Friday.
Fifa’s disciplinary committee had decided against urther ban on Zungu for the second game, away against the Lions of Teranga in Dakar on November 14, Safa said.
Safa had appealed against the red card‚ and automatic one-match suspension Zungu received in Bafana’s 3-1 victory over Burkina Faso at the FNB Stadium last month.
Zungu has also been ordered to pay the cost of Fifa’s sitting on Thursday.
There was fear that‚ despite Safa’s appeal‚ in a worst-case scenario Fifa’s review committee might decide to add a second- game suspension to Zungu’s one‚ if  it decided he had been guilty of violent conduct.
It happened to Bafana defender Mulomowandau Mathoho, for a foul that led to a red card in South Africa’s 2-1 loss to Cape Verde in Praia on September 1‚ which resulted in a two-game suspension and R70000 fine for the Kaizer Chiefs player.
That scenario would have meant Zungu missing both the must-win games against Senegal.
Safa’s appeal to Fifa was made in the hopes of having Zungu available for the first match as well‚ at the Peter Mokaba Stadium.
The midfielder was one of many players from both sides involved in a scuffle in the Burkina game‚ yet somehow singled out for retaliation Zungu and Andile Jali‚ who also has a one-game suspension‚ have been selected in Bafana coach Stuart Baxter’s squad,for the follow-up game in Dakar.
