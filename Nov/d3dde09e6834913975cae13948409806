Huge 7.3% increase as three of province’s key sectors shed jobs nationally
The Eastern Cape, which at 35.5%, has the highest provincial unemployment rate in the country, shed jobs dramatically over the last 12 months, recording a massive 7.3% hike in unemployment.
This emerged from Statistics South Africa’s latest Quarterly Labour Force Survey, which also announced yesterday that the official rate of unemployment nationally remained unchanged from the previous quarter at 27.7%.
The quarterly survey is a householdbased sample survey which collects data on the labour market activities of people aged between 15 and 64, with the survey covering July to September.
In the report, Stats SA revealed that the official unemployment rate remained unchanged in quarter three from quarter two. However, the official unemployment rate declined in five of the nine provinces.
The largest decline in the unemployment rate was recorded in the Free State, which was down by 2.6%, Limpopo (1.7%) and Mpumalanga (1.6%), it said.
“In comparison to the same period last year, the unemployment rate increased by 0.6%,” the report states.
“During this period, the largest increase in the official unemployment rate was recorded in the Eastern Cape where unemployment rose by 7.3%.”
Compared to the second quarter this year, the expanded unemployment rate – which included those who want to work, but did not look for work – increased by 0.2% in quarter three to 36.8%.


Year on year, the expanded unemployment rate increased in six of the nine provinces, with the Eastern Cape fielding the highest increase of 4%.
While unemployment remained at 27.7% nationally in the September quarter, this was a deterioration from the 27.1% for the same quarter last year.
Explaining this, Stats SA said the number of employed people increased by about 92 000 from the June quarter‚ but that this had failed to reduce the overall unemployment level because the working-age population had increased by about 156 000 people.
The survey also showed that seven of the 10 sectors reported growth in people employed.
The best growth sector for jobs was finance and other business services‚ which added 6 000 employees in the quarter.
However‚ manufacturing shed about 50 000 jobs‚ construction around 30 000‚ and agriculture about 25 000.
Nelson Mandela Bay Business Chamber spokeswoman Cindy Preller expressed concern over the figures. “While specific data for the region of Nelson Mandela Bay was not released by Stats SA, we know the region is heavily reliant on the manufacturing sector.
“Job losses are reported nationally in the manufacturing, agriculture and construction sectors – which are three key sectors for the Eastern Cape economy.
“The province is in urgent need of sustainable economic stimulation for our shrinking economy,” she said.
The youth unemployment rate remained at 38.6% for people aged between 15 and 34. At 32.6%, unemployment was high among people who had less than a matric-level education.
