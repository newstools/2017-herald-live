Methodist Church’s Mbete retires after 41 years of service
After 41 years of service in the ministry, Methodist Church of Southern Africa Bishop Andile Mbete was honoured at a glitzy farewell banquet held at the Boardwalk International Conference Centre on Saturday night.
Mbete, 64, who was arrested in Port Elizabeth in the 1980s for his sermons on liberation, said growing up in the former Transkei he had been unaware of the racial tensions and oppression in the country, and when he was exposed to them, “I was shook”.
Mbete said during the height of the struggle between 1983 and 1985, his ministry stretched beyond the walls of the church and in July 1985 he ended up behind bars, spending 10 days at St Albans prison, sharing a cell with 33 other inmates including struggle icons like Mkhuseli Jack.
“The accusation was that I was part of what they [the police] called communist terrorists,” Mbete said.
“It was because my sermons at that stage had changed from preaching a message that said move away from sin towards heaven, but rather informed by the sociopolitical and economic factors trying to relate the Bible to everyday life.”
The president of the South African Council of Churches in the Eastern Cape, and also a member of the Moral Regeneration movement, Mbete served during the presidencies of PW Botha right through to Jacob Zuma.
He said he thought the time was right to step down and retire.
Mbete, who left Port Elizabeth in late 1985 for deployments that took him around the country, returned to the city in 2014.
He described how ministry in the current political climate had changed post-1994.
“Before 1994, the issues of ministry were clear. We were groomed during a time where we had no choice but to be part of a mass movement in search of political freedom,” Mbete said.
Originally from the small town of Willowvale, Mbete said that after 1994, he thought the greatest mistake made by churches was “to trust and put faith in our comrades to deliver the benefits of political freedom”.
“I am sitting with a sense of guilt because I have been part of a leadership that has betrayed the nation by failing to provide theological ministerial insight in the new building of the nation,” he said.
I retire feeling that issues are not going to be easy because the younger ministers have joined the hunger for material possessions.
A gospel that says come to God and you will have a big house and a Mercedes-Benz is not really a spiritual gospel.
“If you talk about Tata uMandela, Tata uTambo, Tata uChris Hani and Tata uMbeki, the one common thing about them is that they all studied in mission schools where there were prayers and so there’s no doubt for me that in trying to rebuild our nation we should be involved in schools.”
With 800 guests, the banquet was attended by Eastern Cape House of Traditional Leaders chairman Nkosi Ngangomhlaba Matanzima, legislature speaker Noxolo Kiviet and Nelson Mandela University outgoing vice- chancellor Derrick Swartz and incoming vice-chancellor Dr Sibongile Muthwa.
Matanzima, one of the speakers at the event, said the country needed men and women like Mbete, who were willing to stand for the truth and defend it.
