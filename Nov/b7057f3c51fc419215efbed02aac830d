Ulster will be missing powerful Springbok loose forward Jean Deysel and six Irish internationals when they face the Southern Kings in a PRO14 showdown at Kwazakhele’s Wolfson Stadium on Saturday.
Apart from Deysel, Ulster will also be without their inspirational skipper Rory Best and five other players who have linked up with the Irish test team.
The Ulster players in the Irish squad preparing for the test against the Springboks in Dublin next week are Best, Stuart McCloskey, Jacob Stockdale, Iain Henderson, Rob Herring and Kieran Treadwell.
Deysel was ruled out of the trip to Port Elizabeth after suffering a recurrence of a shoulder injury.
The Ulster squad, who arrived in South Africa yesterday, will be up against a Kings team that has lost its opening seven games.
“There’s 24 hours of travel, it’s a long flight, and we have to hit the ground there, get one good session and a captain’s run,” Ulster coach Les Kiss said.
In addition to the absence of six Irish squad members, Kyle McCall, Wiehahn Herbst and John Cooney remained doubtful, although Darren Cave should return at the Wolfson Stadium.
“There’s a genuine enthusiasm about it. We’re not going on holiday, we’re going for a job. We’ll have to mix up the training in the off time to make it work.
“Rugby is like that, it gives you those experiences but it comes down to 80 minutes and there’s no doubt we’re excited and enthused about it,” Kiss said.


Meanwhile, there has been a passionate plea from Kings coach Deon Davids for fans to rally behind his team at the Wolfson Stadium.
So far the Kings have lost all seven of their opening matches, with their latest defeat coming at the hands of Glasgow Warriors in Scotland.
Kings officials switched Saturday’s match from the 46 000-seater Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in a bid to boost support after small crowds watched the Bay team’s opening two home games.
“The support of our crowd in the Eastern Cape is very important to us,” Davids said.
“The Kings always get a lot of energy out of the tremendous support we receive from them.
“We want to ask our loyal supporters to come out in their numbers.
“We are really going to work hard and try our best to put up a good performance.
“I feel if we can build on the first 60 minutes of the Glasgow game, and play with the same effort and intensity and better our execution we will make it worthwhile for them,” the coach said.
The Kings will name their team to face Ulster tomorrow.
