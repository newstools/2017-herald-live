A Port Elizabeth primary school caretaker has been suspended pending an investigation into why he gave gifts like money and wooden hearts to several pupils and allegedly sent inappropriate messages to a Grade 6 child.
While authorities have supplied limited details of the SMS messages between the 65-year-old Charlo Primary caretaker and the 11-year-old girl, they said the messages were not of a sexual nature.
The school and the provincial Department of Education have launched probes, while police said an inquiry had been opened for investigation by the Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit.
It emerged yesterday that school principal Joe McLeod had been sidelined from the investigation as he is related to the caretaker.
Authorities confirmed that the matter came to light when a pupil’s parents found a series of SMS messages on their daughter’s cellphone.
While only one pupil received messages from the man, others received gifts made of wood in the shape of hearts and teddy bears.


The motive for the messages is still unclear.
This comes only weeks after Collegiate Girls’ High was rocked by a drug scandal that led to a teacher being fired after an internal hearing into allegations of cocaine use in the presence of pupils.
The Department of Education said in a statement that Charlo Primary’s school governing body (SGB) was alerted to the messages last week and immediately suspended the caretaker.
A letter sent to parents on Monday – signed by SGB chairman Dr Braam van der Schyff, vice-chairman Jaco Snyders and member Marius Smuts – states that the allegations are serious and an investigation has been launched.
While only one pupil’s parents have raised the alarm, the SGB and department have called for other parents to come forward if they suspect their children may also have received messages or gifts.
“It came to our attention on Thursday that some learners at the school received gifts and inappropriate SMS messages from the SGB employee,” the letter states.
“The SGB will make use of professionals to gather evidence and to determine the impact of the allegations.”


The letter said McLeod could not be involved in the investigation due to a conflict of interest.
Van der Schyff and Snyders failed to respond to voicemails, but Smuts said information was limited as the matter was subject to investigation.
The letter said a clinical psychologist had been called in to address pupils and parents.
Provincial education spokesman Loyiso Pulumani said the allegations were viewed in a serious light.
Asked about the gifts given to pupils, Pulumani said they were in the form of presents and money.
“The messages will remain confidential for now as they form part of an investigation.
“Suffice it to say they were deemed to be inappropriate.”
Pulumani said an independent investigator had been sent to the school on Monday.
“The department intends to get to the bottom of this serious allegation immediately.”


Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said detectives who specialised in investigations involving children would assist.
“As a preliminary process, we have opened an inquiry to investigate if any laws have been contravened,” she said.
“Once this is established, we shall consult with the National Prosecuting Authority which will decide on a way forward.
“The messages were sent to one person only, but gifts made of wood, such as hearts and teddy bears, were given to other learners,” Naidu said.
Attempts to contact McLeod were unsuccessful, with the school’s receptionist saying he did not want to comment.
