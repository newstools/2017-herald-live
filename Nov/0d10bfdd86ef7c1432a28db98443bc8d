Nelson Mandela Bay is losing more than 40% of its water supply every month to leaks, burst pipes, incorrect billing and water that residents have not paid for.
In September alone, the city lost about 3.5 megalitres – or 41.5% – of its water supply.
In the past financial year it lost a total of 35.912ML, translating to about R167.7-million.
About 30% of the Bay’s water supply is being lost due to leaks and burst pipes.
The financial report for the first quarter of the new financial year was tabled in the budget and treasury standing committee meeting yesterday and revealed that water losses were expected to only worsen in the current financial year.
Dam levels are averaging at just under a critical 30% in combined capacity.
More water restrictions are expected to be announced by the end of the week, according to municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki.
Councillors on the committee called for an immediate and holistic approach to combat the crisis.
Other staggering revelations in the financial report for July to September included:
ý Electricity losses amounted to R362.2-million in the 2016-17 financial year.
ý Bridge funding for housing top structures (a provincial government function) is standing at R194.72-million.
DA councillor Leander Kruger said: “It is concerning that the water losses are predicted to be higher in this financial year than previous years. We need to seriously look at an intervention [plan] for these losses.


“We are losing revenue and valuable resources. We need to look at a holistic and long-term approach [to] fix this – we can’t keep putting plasters on it.”
EFF councillor Yoliswa Yako said the city needed to nip the problem in the bud.
“I don’t know what needs to be done in terms of fixing infrastructure because with the Assistance to the Poor [programme] rates collection, water is the one that generates the most losses.
“Most of these households are not using this water but it seeps [leaks].
“It is not being consumed and a lot of [the] budget is going towards that.
“If we nip this [the leaks] in the bud now, it is going to help in the long run that we don’t pay off debt we are not supposed to have in the first place.”
But infrastructure, electricity and engineering political head Annette Lovemore said the department was working on a 10-year plan to tackle non-revenue water loss in the city.
“There is no excuse, these figures are way too high,” she said.
“This report talks about non-revenue water – every bit of water that we have paid for but have not received revenue for. It includes leaks, water that has not been billed correctly or that people have not paid for.


“The water loss is sitting at about 30%, but we do have a plan.”

ANC councillor Rory Riordan demanded to know why amid the drought and ailing infrastructure the municipality had not spent more than R100-million set aside for repairs and maintenance.
According to the report, repairs and maintenance was under-spent by R103.77-million compared to the 2016-17 adjustment budget.
“The under-spending of maintenance and repairs money continues and we need to change that,” Riordan said.
Electricity acting executive director Peter Nielson said: “It’s a big concern around electricity and water losses and they are not going down – despite the efforts being made, they are actually going up.
“One must not look at the monthto-month because during the three winter months we have our biggest accounts where we calculate the losses.”
He said the electricity losses were running at 16% “which is far too high”.
“We have started with our back-tobasics programme in KwaNobuhle, where it was highlighted that a number of meters had been bypassed or tampered with.”
He said an audit revealed that more than 20 000 meters in the area had been tampered with.
Meanwhile, communities around the metro continue to bear the brunt of service-delivery disruptions due to ongoing disputes between the municipality and its workers.


More water leaks are appearing in various parts of the city.
At the Kleinskool Community Primary School, clean water has been gushing out since Thursday, a matter that principal Sean Abrahams said he had reported several times.
“We logged calls with the toll-free number expecting that, because we’ve got water shortages, the problem would be dealt with speedily,” he said.
“We were told the reason for the tardiness was the strike between artisans and the municipality.”
Abrahams said the school had no water and they were collecting it from neighbouring homes in drums.
“We’re going to parents’ homes filling buckets so the children can use the ablution facilities,” he said.
“Since Friday, school has been closing at 11am because there is no water.
“But we cannot let the children stay home because they are preparing for exams.”
The municipality and its employees have been in a standoff, with the workers demanding they be paid according to a longstanding collective agreement rather than a new overtime policy.
In the 2016-17 year, the city spent more than R162-million on overtime.
Corporate services and human resources executive director Vuyo Zitumane said yesterday the municipality had to review the overtime policy after it emerged that overtime had been incorrectly applied for a number of years.
The new policy was passed on May 23 at a council meeting.
