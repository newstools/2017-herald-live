Jacques Pauw, author of the explosive new book ‘The President’s Keepers’File picture: Lifestyle Magazine
The family of State Security Agency boss Arthur Fraser are demanding a retraction of Jacques Pauw’s controversial book The President’s Keepers‚ charging he has unjustly accused them of criminal activity.
In a statement yesterday, the family claimed Pauw had committed “the classic journalistic deception of not allowing facts to get in the way of a good story” in his book.
And in a lawyer’s letter to the State Security Agency yesterday, NB Publishers said it would not desist from making Pauw’s book available to the public‚ would not withdraw it from the market and would not retract any parts of it.
The SSA served NB Publishers and Pauw with a cease-and-desist letter last week in which it demanded the book be withdrawn from bookshops and parts of it be retracted.
It claimed parts of the book contravened the Intelligence Service Act.
The book alleges Fraser was complicit in looting hundreds of millions of rands from the Principle Agent Network (PAN) slush fund and was potentially guilty of treason for setting up a computer server at his home into which the PAN reports were fed.


“In his enthusiasm to influence ruling party politics and the 2019 general election‚ Pauw has allowed himself to be manipulated by an apartheid spy/double agent who has scores to settle – and is now hiding out in Russia,” the family said.
They claimed the book contained the following errors, among others:

Fraser’s sister was married to intelligence officer Graham Engel;
Barry Fraser was the director of a company and NGO that benefited from an alleged intelligence operation dubbed PAN; and
CF Fraser‚ 83‚ is a PAN agent.

Meanwhile, Willem de Klerk for NB Publishers writes in the letter to the SSA that thousands of copies of the book have been sold and much of the information in it has been widely disseminated in the media.
There can thus not be any basis for an urgent court application to prevent the further distribution of the book‚ NB Publishers argue.
On the SSA’s claim that the book is “replete with inaccuracies”‚ the response is that it is not backed up by a single reference in the book that is alleged to be inaccurate.
