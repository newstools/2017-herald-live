I’m writing from KwaNobuhle. We have an electricity crisis in Uitenhage – it’s been two weeks. When we called Kwanolec they told us they were striking.
The second time we called they told us it was Athol Trollip who had stopped giving overtime [payments]. The third time they said they’d answer us in December.
They didn’t have trucks and we should go to Trollip’s office because they were not fighting with us, they were fighting against Trollip.


It’s very tiring because some of our children are pupils and they can’t study at night because it’s dark. We ended up throwing our meats away because they were damaged.
We are a fed-up community and we feel abandoned by our own municipality. It is not taking us seriously and it’s very disrespectful when they don’t even notify us about the switch-off of the electricity.
Please, we need help urgently – we are broken.
