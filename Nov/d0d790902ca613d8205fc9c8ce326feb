The first Nelson Mandela Bay Legacy jazz festival was launched yesterday at the Opera House with a star-studded lineup on its two-night programme later this month.

Opera House manager Monde Ngonyama introduced two of the headline artists – pianist Andile Yenana and bassist Lex Futshane – at the launch as among several professionals to lead performances on November 24 and 25. Other headliners include Nelson Mandela University jazz lecturer John Edwards, vocalists Sizwe Yaze and Dumza Maswana and multi-instrumentalist Sintethemba Ncethani.


“Why have we all along lacked a jazz centre?” Ngonyama asked, referring to the rich legacy of jazz in this region while lamenting that so many artists left for greener pastures elsewhere.
“So few national jazz artists are based in PE and travel from here.”
Yenana, originally from King William’s Town but now based in KwaZulu-Natal, and Futshane, born and bred in New Brighton but now based in Johannesburg, both welcomed the initiative.
“I’m excited to come home to play. Port Elizabeth has a lot of jazz musicians so why don’t we have a decent festival?” Futshane asked.
Yenana said he had learnt his craft from several Bay legends.
“I met the greatest musicians in this city and they embraced me as their little brother, I feel as if I was riding on their coat-tails,” he said, paying tribute to the late Zim Ngqawana and Lulu Gontsana in particular.
Yenana, Futshane and Ncethani gave the launch guests a taste of what to expect at the Jazz Legacy Festival when they played a number that will be on the programme.
Ncethani also will curate the lineup, which will be made public shortly.
“We want to look at the festival and see when and how it can grow. This is the beginning, and while it is here in Port Elizabeth, it is an embrace of all the province has to offer.”
