Tasneen Ebrahim, 15, will be looking to fly the South African flag high after being selected for the national open water swimming team to compete at the Junior World Championships in Mauritius on December 2-3.
Having started her official swimming lessons when she was 11, the St Dominic’s Priory pupil has achieved qualification times at various levels.
Her hard work and discipline was rewarded with national selection to the Zone3 Games in Rwanda last year.

“I raced in six different races and won five gold medals in what was a highly competitive event,” Ebrahim said.
“When I returned, I made a decision this was what I wanted to do but I had to increase my work rate.
“My new training routine spans six days a week, with a total of about 140km swum in nine sessions.
“During this time, I took to open water swimming, achieving qualification times in 3km and 5km races.”
She was selected to represent the Eastern Cape at the Open Water Nationals in March this year.


Notably, she was the only girl selected to swim both the 3km and 5km events.
As there are no age groups in open water, she swam to a top 15 place in the nationals.
She was recently selected for the South African team which competed at the Len Cup in Rome, Italy, where she ended in the top 20.
Ebrahim has represented the provincial team for three consecutive years at the South African Schools Championships.
She also finished in the top 10 in the SPAR River Mile in her debut race this year.
