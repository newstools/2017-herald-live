On a Monday evening, at the beginning of last month, a man walked into a computer lab at the Nelson Mandela University.
In the building were two female students.
He attacked and raped them, and then forced them to help him carry out the equipment he stole.
It was a savage act of violence from a common thug with no regard for human life.
There was outrage. The next day students gathered in protest.
At a public meeting with the university management, they demanded that head of security Derek Huebsch be fired.
They believed he was incompetent and blamed him for poor security on campus.
The attack was not the first incident of crime on campus. For some time female students in particular had increasingly felt vulnerable.
Like the rest of Nelson Mandela Bay, the campus can at times be a dangerous place for them. Therefore their anger was justified. During the protest the students, predominantly black, said they were tired of depending on Huebsch, a white man, to keep them safe.
Of course there is an important subtext to this statement – real or perceived. Here’s my interpretation of it. The students felt that from his vantage point of power and privilege, Huebsch did not fully grasp the nuances of life on campus, especially for students whose minimal resources and limited agency exposed them to dangerous circumstances more than anyone else on campus.
As a result, they believed, the very security strategy of the institution, incidentally or by design, was not far-reaching enough.
It did not adequately appreciate the extent of their vulnerability and therefore it failed to protect them when they needed it most.
I have no doubt that Huebsch may have a different view.
Nonetheless, at the public meeting students demanded that deputy vice-chancellor Dr Sibongile Muthwa fire Huebsch right there and then.
Doing so would also demonstrate solidarity on her part.
In response, Muthwa showed empathy and support to them.
She undertook to address their security demands listed on their memorandum. However, she would not agree to fire Huebsch.
There were laws and processes in place that guided how institutions should deal with such matters, she told them.

Outraged, some of the students took to social media expressing their anger at what they saw as her betrayal.
Meanwhile, those who supported Huebsch expressed their disappointment at what they believed was Muthwa’s endorsement of the student’s “anti-white narrative”.
They demanded action and a public condemnation of the students’ narrative.
To them, too, she refused, stating that there were procedures to follow when students, or any university player, had broken the rules.
Last week, from her office on the 18th floor of the university’s Main building, I listened to Muthwa tell this story with a deep sense of deliberation.
“For me that is a classic example of a problem that has to be handled with a lot of deep reflection, maturity and consistency,” she says.
Usually softly-spoken, Muthwa’s voice grows stern when she speaks about the concept of social justice. She is steady and emphatic. Those close to her say it is a value system that defines the woman who is soon to lead the Eastern Cape’s biggest tertiary institution.


Announced last month as the university’s vice-chancellor to take over from Prof Derrick Swartz, Muthwa appears cognisant of the enormity of the task ahead.
Like any other institution of higher learning in South Africa, the Mandela University is on a journey of change.
Not least of all because of the #FeesMustFall protests, the last two years in particular have been a pivotal chapter for the university.
Its management decisions earned it friends and foes in its own corridors and beyond.
It was a period that tested its resolve to transform fairly and credibly.
Perhaps more than any other, this chapter demonstrated how challenges in universities mirror our country’s social landscape.
In her term, Muthwa must lead a diverse university on a journey of innovation.
Equally she must lead an institution that is also a battleground for competing ideas and interests right up to its higher echelons of power. So how on earth does she plan to do it? She points to the 20/60/20 leadership rule. “In an institution there are 20% of the people who would support the vision of the leader. And then there are 20% who do not support it.
“There is the 60% of people who are just fine. They are not strongly for or against the vision.
“They just come and do the work and do it honestly. But if you want to drive change, you need that 60% to be your main target.
“You need them to buy into the 20% that support you.”
Supporters have hailed Muthwa’s appointment as a historic moment that bodes well for transformation in the university.
She agrees, but also points out that the change leadership project is more complex than many believe.
“If you are a state president, for example, once your party wins you the position of president you lead the country, you don’t lead the group that chose you to the position.
“My identity and my heritage, being black African and being a woman, comes with a lot of expectations from people that look like me, to prioritise their cause.
“But we don’t lead like that. We dare not lead like that.
“One must take a posture that does not change with circumstances, that does not change according to who is the last person you spoke to.
“For me this is a responsibility of a leader in a multi-cultural organisation like ours.
“I don’t intend to reinforce the status quo, where disadvantage takes place.
“Yes, there is a project of driving change, in our country and in this institution. “But based on what values? “Based on what ethos?” How then does she define social justice in the context of this institution?
“When every student and staff, regardless of who they are, truly feels that they belong here.
“When we honour our primary role to shorten the distance between privilege and deprivation.”
