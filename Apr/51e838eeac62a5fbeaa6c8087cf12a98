Gold hit a five-month high of $1,295.42 yesterday as the dollar weakened with investors taking refuge in safe-haven assets in the wake of rising geopolitical tensions over North Korea. &#8220;Gold will likely retain a measure of strength heading into the French elections in about one week&#8217;s time, while ongoing tensions in North Korea should also keep the markets rather nervous,&#8221; said INTL FCStone analyst Edward Meir. The dollar dipped to a five-month low against the yen early yesterday. The bullish sentiment in gold was underscored by data showing speculators increased their net long positions for a fourth straight week to April 11. New York-listed SPDR Gold Shares ETF, the world&#8217;s biggest gold-backed exchange-traded fund, said its holdings rose more than six tonnes on Thursday, the biggest one-day inflow in a month. Uncertainties over US President Donald Trump&#8217;s policy on North Korea have been growing since the US Navy fired 59 Tomahawk missiles at a Syrian airfield on April 6. Adding to these concerns, the US military last week dropped the largest non-nuclear device it has ever used in combat on a network of caves and tunnels used by Islamic State in eastern Afghanistan. &#8220;Gold is trading with an upward bias with the $1300 level just in sight. We expect any dips in prices to be eagerly sought by traders,&#8221; said Jeffrey Halley, a senior market analyst at Oanda.
