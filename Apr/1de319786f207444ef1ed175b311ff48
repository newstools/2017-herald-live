PRETTY SETTING: The settling pond at the Cape Recife Waste Water Treatment Works in Port Elizabeth attracts numerous birds. Residents may fetch water from the works Picture: MARTHEANNE FINNEMORE While the drought continues unabated, there is a source of recycled water available at the municipal Cape Recife Waste Water Treatment Works. This water is suitable for use on gardens. It is free, but users need to be able to fetch the water, thus requiring a trailer or bakkie and tank. The works are open during normal working hours from Monday to Friday. Robert and his team at the works are very helpful and go the extra mile to ensure that water is available in spite of some equipment hiccups, like when a puffadder got into the pumphouse. An extra bonus is that while fetching water there you get to see this beautiful settling pond, pictured above, home to hundreds of birds.
