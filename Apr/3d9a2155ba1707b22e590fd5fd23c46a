A pedestrian made the gruesome discovery of a murder victim who had been axed to death, and had the axe still lodged in her head, in Missionvale early yesterday. The body of Nobengazi Notshoba, 49, was found in an open field near Tromp Street at about 6.30am. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Alwin Labans said Notshoba was believed to have been killed some time overnight. It appears that she was murdered in the field. The motive is unknown as nothing appeared to be missing and she was fully clothed, he said. Anyone with information is asked to contact the Algoa Park police station.
