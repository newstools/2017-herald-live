The Port Elizabeth legal team representing Durban-based televangelist Timothy Omotoso have brought an urgent application at the Port Elizabeth high court in order to determine the whereabouts of their client. This comes after Omotoso was arrested by the Hawks Human Trafficking unit in Port Elizabeth this afternoon [20/04/17] on a charge of alleged human trafficking the elite police unit confirmed. Omotoso is being represented by Port Elizabeth attorney Alwyn Griebenow and Advocate Terry Price SC. Price said they were drafting papers in order to bring an urgent application before the Port Elizabeth High Court to have Omotoso brought before the courts to discover his whereabouts. We want to have him brought before court because they are not telling us where he is. I am his lawyer but I do not even know where he is, Price said. &#8220;He cannot be arrested without an arrest warrant and when I asked they refused to show one to me.&#8221; They are the scum of the earth. They are worse than Mugabe s thugs in Zimbabwe. Since when do you arrest an unarmed pastor with eight armed men. He is not a danger. Omotoso was arrested shortly after arriving at the Port Elizabeth international airport this afternoon. The 58-year-old pastor allegedly trafficked young women and girls from various branches of his church to a house in uMhlanga Kwazulu-Natal where he allegedly exploited them sexually Hawks spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Robert Netshiunda said.
