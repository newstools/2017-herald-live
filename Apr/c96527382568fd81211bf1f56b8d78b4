Sesethu Gqomo (in sunglasses) is an advocate for natural hair The growing trend in Nelson Mandela Bay to join #TeamNatural for hair that is curly, coiled, kinky, super dry and hard to manage has seen two women join forces to host a seminar later this month on how to take care of natural hair. Hair specialist Zemvelo Ndaba and hair product distributor Sesethu Gqomo will present Earthy Hair Talks on Sunday afternoon, April 30, in Walmer, after noticing a lack of services and products for Bay women with natural hair. We initially met at an Absa Entrepreneurial Workshop and started chatting, and we discovered a niche in the market when it came to treating natural hair, Gqomo said. Seeing that I m a natural hair care distributor and she has extensive knowledge on treating natural hair, we collaborated and created an event called Earthy Hair Talks. Zemvelo will be talking about the different types of natural hair and how to treat them accordingly, Gqomo said. She added that she will be explaining products aimed at caring for natural hair, including hair butter, oil, mist, pillowcases and shampoos and conditioner. Earthy Talks is on Sunday, April 30 from 2pm to 4pm at Pintxos Tapas and Wine Bar in Walmer. Tickets are R150, which includes refreshments and a powerpoint presentation on hair care.
