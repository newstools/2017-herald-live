Dineo Ranaka Picture: James Oatway Popular TV personality Dineo Ranaka is the new co-host of Metro FM s The Front Row replacing Bonang Matheba. Dineo stepped into the role only hours after Bonang announced that she had resigned from the station. She started her first show as co-host with Lerato Kganyago this morning. Speaking to TshisaLIVE SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago confirmed that Dineo had joined Metro FM and said the station did all it could to replace Bonang with someone of a similar quality. Dineo is the new co-host and will be on the show for the foreseeable future. We are a business and when one person leaves, we work hard to replace them with someone of a similar quality Kganyago said. Fans have flooded Twitter with a string of comments and memes to share their thoughts on the move. Dineo s appointment comes less than 24 hours since Bonang resigned from the station. Despite insiders claiming that Bonang resigned after being informed about co-hosting with Lerato Kganyago Bonang rubbished the claims. Bonang told TshisaLIVE that she left on principle and that she was only notified about the changes an hour before she went on air. It could have been anybody else in that chair. It could have been a male female a famous person or a non-famous person. It was principle that mattered to me she said.
