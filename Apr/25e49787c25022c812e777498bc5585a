Andile Lungisa File picture: TimesLIVE Nelson Mandela Bay ANC councillor Andile Lungisa, who is facing charges of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, had his case postponed yesterday after mistakenly forgetting a doctor s note in a different jacket. The note will serve as proof that Lungisa could not attend his previous court date, April 11. He is accused of hitting DA councillor Rano Kayser over the head with a glass jug during a council brawl. Appearing separately, councillor Gamalihleli Maqula, who is facing a similar charge, is accused of stabbing DA chief whip Werner Senekal in the back with a sharp object during the same heated council meeting last year. Both cases were postponed to May 10. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
