Three men have been arrested for allegedly committing fraud in Walmer. Police spokeswoman Captain Sandra Janse Van Rensburg said the three between the ages of 20 and 30 allegedly distracted a 39-year-old woman withdrawing money from an ATM in Main Road, Walmer at about 2.15pm on Wednesday (05/04/17). The scammers managed to steal her card and money was withdrawn from her account at three different ATMs in the Walmer area, Janse Van Rensburg said. Members of the Flying Squad received information regarding the whereabouts of the suspects and followed up on the information which led them to the arrest of three suspects in the vicinity of Kwazakhele. Police confiscated the Volkswagen Polo the suspects were driving and their cellphones. Card scheming at our ATMs is a big concern and the arrest is a breakthrough, Janse Van Rensburg said. The investigator will also follow up and investigate if they could be linked to other cases in the Port Elizabeth area. The three are expected to appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court on charges of fraud on Friday (07/04/17). Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
