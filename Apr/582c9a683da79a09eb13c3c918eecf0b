The NMMU Music Department will host the ANiCA Trio on Tuesday, April 4 at 7.30pm at the Music Conservatoire at the Bird Street Campus in Central. The ANiCA trio comprises American Caleb Vaughn-Jones on on the cello, Polish pianist Joanna Wicherek and South Africa s Nick Fidler on the viola. This ensemble of young, active performing musicians from wildly contrasting backgrounds, has led to robust interpretations and dramatic contrasts, covering a broad range of the emotions encountered throughout the human experience. A spokesman for the department said the programme was a bold and uncompromising tribute to emotive colours and romantic vigour. Although most of the music in this programme is modern, the selected works are melodic and are underpinned by rich, neo-romantic harmonies. Although each piece is an intense journey through a very specific stand-alone soundscape, this programme balances itself out very well, contrasting bombastic Russian flamboyance with a wholesome, meditative American work; and minimalism s striking starkness with the full-bodied depth and warmth of Brahms to tie the whole performance together. The programme includes: Alexey Kurbatov s trio for viola, cello and piano; Geoff Knorr s Aurora for cello and piano; Arvo P rt s Fratres for viola and piano; Johannes Brahms s trio for clarinet (with the viola substituted for the clarinet), cello and piano. Tickets are R50 for adults, R30 for pensioners, R20 for students or pupils, and are on sale at the door. Inquiries: Nicky Bosman. (041) 504-4235.
