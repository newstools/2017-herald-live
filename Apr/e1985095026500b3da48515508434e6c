The National Sea Rescue Institute has sent out a warning of strongerthan-normal rip currents this weekend as well as a shark alert along the Garden Route. NSRI spokesman Craig Lambinon said the new moon spring tide which peaked on Wednesday would result in stronger-than-normal rip currents. The phenomenon would persist until Tuesday, he said. Bathers, paddlers and anglers are urged to exercise caution around the coast over the long weekend. Adding to the concerns, a shark alert has been issued along the Southern Cape coastline, between Nature s Valley and Mossel Bay, particularly around the Plettenberg Bay area, due to a high number of white shark sightings. Lambinon said it was normal this time of year for sharks to come close to shore. The increase in shark inshore presence at this time of the year is part of the normal aggregation of these animals . . . to take advantage of naturally occurring prey like seals and fish close to shore, he said.
