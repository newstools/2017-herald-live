The equipment included a soccer kit, netball balls and cricket safety gear. The primary school is just one of the schools in Motherwell and Zwide receiving a helping hand from the National Lottery. At the handover, Nelson Mandela Bay Sports Legends chairman Themba Ludwaba spoke about grooming youngsters wanting to take up sport from a young age. The only way our children can escape the harsh realities of the township is by engaging in sport and keeping busy, he said. Former Cricket South Africa chief executive Gerald Majola encouraged parents to support their children at matches. Our children aspire to be as good as the children in former model C schools, he said. It is all up to us as parents to give our children the necessary support. Children should also be encouraged to consider a sporting career so that they can change their families situation. The schools have been tasked to formulate fixtures on a weekly basis to promote continuity and competitiveness among them. Canzibe Primary School principal Nokuzola Jindela said the school would be filing an application for adequate fields and sporting facilities. We have taken it upon ourselves to ensure that our children do not have to travel long distances to part take in sporting activities, Jindela said. An in-house soccer field and netball court would give our children more time to become better at what they do. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
