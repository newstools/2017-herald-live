Call by religious leaders in Bay for ruling party to recall President Zuma Unhappy church leaders in Nelson Mandela Bay are calling for a complete overhaul of the ANC s top echelon, or for President Jacob Zuma to resign, following his cabinet reshuffle. The call for Zuma to step down has gained momentum following the midnight axing on Thursday of former finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy, Mcebisi Jonas, as well as other ministers and deputy ministers. Word of Faith Christian Centre pastor Dr Jimmy Crompton said it was not a question only of Zuma stepping down, but rather a complete overhaul of the entire ANC leadership. I am deeply disappointed at the ANC leadership for failing to stand up, he said. I applaud Gordhan and Jonas for having the courage to speak out, he said. Crompton said he strongly believed God was still in control despite the volatile political climate. He urged citizens to pray for divine intervention. God will raise up a man or woman to stand against what is happening. We are in big trouble if we don t stand up, he said. The outcry from religious leaders comes as the Save South Africa campaign prepares to hold a rally at Vuyisile Mini Square at the Port Elizabeth City Hall today.
