The second Amarula Bay Fashion Sunday was held at the Roof Garden Bar in Central this past weekend, bringing a crop of six young designers to the ramp and a chance for a spot at Mandela Bay Fashion Week later in the year. The aim of Amarula BFS, say the organisers, is to create a talent search platform whereby designers and models will be sourced from townships and urban areas to showcase their work. Progressive designers will be selected from here to partake in Mandela Bay Fashion Week, which this year will be offering cash prizes to the value of R60 000. Additionally, there is a chance for one or more designers to showcase at their annual Fashion Awards in Johannesburg. &nbsp; Pictures: Gillian McAinsh Pictures: Gillian McAinsh &nbsp; Ntombozuko Venge s Zuko Couture Ntombozuko Venge s Zuko Couture focussed on extremely wearable floor-length dresses, which were fluid and feminine.
