Capping her son, Anthony Evlambiou, was a proud moment for Anastasia Petratos. A poignant moment between a mother and her son captured the hearts of guests at a NMMU graduation ceremony at the Indoor Sports Centre on South Campus this week. Anastasia Petratos, 50, director of the department of information communication technology at NMMU, who graduated with a PhD in information technology, had the honour of capping her eldest son, BSc honours in zoology graduate Anthony Evlambiou, 23. She said the experience was very emotional and special. I was very emotional, but made a point of not spoiling it by crying, but even talking about it I get all teary-eyed, Petratos said. Meanwhile, the former Theodor Herzl High School pupil said it felt great being capped by his mother and was an experience he would never forget. It was such a special moment for me and it just motivated me to want to do more and study further just like my mom. What made the day even more special was having my family there, my grandmother and my brother, Daniel, cheering us on, he said. Evlambiou said his mother had told him about her plans to cap him last year when she found out they would be graduating on the same day. The mother of two said she returned to her studies after an 18-year gap and has been with NMMU for 30 years, gaining her master s degree two weeks before Anthony was born. I always wanted to do my PhD but with two little kids it wasn t always easy so when Anthony matriculated, I decided to go for it, she said.
