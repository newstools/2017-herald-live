Charlize Theron Oscar winner Charlize Theron said it was an exciting challenge to play the main villain in the latest instalment of the Fast and Furious racing film series. This is a franchise that has been built for 16 years on this idea of family being kind of the cornerstone and to play a character that has to break all of that up, it was fun, and challenging, Theron said at the Berlin premiere of The Fate of the Furious. Vin Diesel was also on hand for the release of the film, which is being marketed in Europe as Fast and Furious 8 and features the signature fast car chases, daring stunts and explosions of the previous seven films. The new film sees Diesel s lead character Dominic Toretto go rogue. Theron plays the villainous Cipher. The film, directed by F Gary Gray, also stars Jason Statham, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez and Tyrese Gibson.
