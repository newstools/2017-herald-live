A strike by SAA cabin crew is expected to disrupt air travel Picture: Jan Bornman Travellers are warned of disruptions in air travel today as a cabin crew strike takes hold. Four South African Airways (SAA) flights had to be cancelled this morning and others delayed affecting routes between Johannesburg and Cape Town Port Elizabeth and East London. This was confirmed by SAA spokesman Tlali Tlali. The South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA) secretary general Mpho Moikangoa said the union was striking over meal allowances which had remained stagnant for the past six years. Moikangoa said negotiations with SAA were unsuccessful on Tuesday afternoon as the airline was offering an increase of R84.90 whereas the union wanted nothing less than R352. Crew members are given a R1 711 ($131) meal allowance per day. We spend 20 days out of the country and the hotels we sleep in are expensive and we can t afford breakfast at times. We are forced to eat at places like McDonald s said Moikangoa. The union represents 1 300 of the 1 700 airline crew members at SAA.
