Slain struggle stalwart Chris Hani s widow Limpho has denounced reports that she is against President Jacob Zuma. Speaking at a wreath-laying ceremony commemorating the 24th anniversary of her husband s assassination Limpho said she had she attended a prayer session for the country and was accused of being part of a faction against Zuma. &#8220;Comrades I am a member of the ANC and there is only one ANC &#8221; said Limpho. She took a swipe at the media quoting Malcolm X as having said media were known for misconstruing facts. She also praised Zuma saying he was a pillar of strength to her when her eldest daughter was addicted to cocaine. Zuma who led the wreath-laying ceremony announced that Hani s gravesite in Boksburg on Johannesburg s East Rand had been declared a national heritage site. The SACP as well as ANC members among others present at the Thomas Nkobi cemetery in Boksburg welcomed Zuma chanting &#8220;Zuma-Zuma&#8221; as he was introduced. Reverend Maphatsoe in his opening prayer said the ceremony was not to be tainted by political point-scoring as requested by the president and that the message was no longer Save SA but rather Defend SA .
