State advocate Marius Stander, left, Captain Kanna Swanepoel, centre, and defence advocate Terry Price SC File picture: Eugene Coetzee Jibes were exchanged on Friday morning between the investigating officer in Jayde Panayiotou&#8217;s murder and the man defending her husband as cross-examination resumed in the Port Elizabeth High Court. At one point, advocate Terry Price SC, told Captain Kanna Swanepoel that he was well-balanced because he had a chip on both shoulders. Swanepoel then confronted Price about paying for the girlfriend of self-confessed middleman, Luthando Siyoni, to undergo an eye test, as well as a six-month supply of contact lenses. When Price responded that he was &#8220;generous&#8221;, Swanepoel said this was all done without the court granting the defence permission to consult with Babalwa Breakfast. Price said he did not appreciate Swanepoel&#8217;s insinuations. Referring to a second number Christopher Panayiotou used to contact Siyoni before the sting was set up, Price said this phone was given to him by his friend and IT expert, Donovan Vosloo. Price said Panayiotou used this phoned because he didn&#8217;t want Siyoni bothering him on his personal phone. Price also criticised the police for working on Panayiotou&#8217;s emotions by getting Siyoni to phone Panayiotou just hours after his wife&#8217;s funeral. Testimony continues on Friday afternoon.
