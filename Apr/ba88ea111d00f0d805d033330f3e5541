A suspected burglar bit off more than he could chew yesterday when he broke into a house in Port Elizabeth and had a run-in with the homeowner s pitbull. The burglar was arrested inside the house and his accomplices were nabbed by police in Bethelsdorp within three hours of the crime. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said the suspects broke into the house in Middle Street, North End, at about 3.15am. There were three men inside the house and the 30year-old owner woke to find the suspects in his room. They attempted to attack him with a knife when he jumped out of bed and confronted them. The pitbull then entered into the fray while the homeowner fought off the burglars. During the fight, the other suspects fled in what was later established to be the home owner s VW Golf. Naidu said one of the men was bitten by the pitbull on his ear and legs after falling down. The suspect was taken to hospital and treated. He was then released into police custody. By 6am the stolen vehicle had been spotted in Rensburg Street in Bethelsdorp. Police intercepted the vehicle and arrested the three occupants. The car was pulled over and all the suspects were arrested, Naidu said. Due to the three people in the vehicle aged 21, 26 and 29 not yet being directly linked to the attack, they will be charged with being in possession of a stolen car. The other man who was inside the house was arrested for house robbery. Detectives and forensic investigators are working to link the three men to the house robbery as well, Naidu said. All four are due to appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court tomorrow. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
