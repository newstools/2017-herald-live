Three suspects are expected to appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court next week after they were arrested towing a stolen car early on Thursday morning. Police spokeswoman Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said police officers were patrolling the M4 freeway, in the vicinity of North End, at about 1am when they spotted a Toyota Corolla towing a Mazda 323. The vehicles were stopped and officers verified their details. According to information they received, the Mazda had been stolen in Central, but when officers contacted the owner he had not yet realised his vehicle was missing, Janse van Rensburg said. The suspects, aged between 21 and 26, were arrested on the scene, and both vehicles were impounded pending further investigation. The police are also trying to establish whether the suspects could be linked to other vehicle thefts around the city. Mount Road cluster commander Major-General Funeka Siganga said vehicle theft, especially the theft of older models, was a concern, and commended the officers for their vigilance and the swift arrests.
