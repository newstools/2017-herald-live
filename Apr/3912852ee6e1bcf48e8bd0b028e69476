Morne Blignault. Picture: Supplied Racketeering accused Port Elizabeth businessman Morne Blignault stands to lose the R250 000 bail he paid after he was rearrested Friday morning on another perlemoen-related charge. This time Blignault, 45, a former nightclub owner, is accused alongside his son, Morne junior, and his co-accused in the racketeering case, Jacob Japie Naumann, 35. The three will remain in custody over the weekend and are expected to appear in the Paterson Magistrate s Court on Monday for a date for a formal bail application to be arranged. They were arrested by a Hawks team early Friday morning after they were allegedly linked to perlemoen recovered in Kinkelbos, outside PE. Blignault raised eyebrows last year when he paid a staggering quarter-of-a-million in bail to secure his release on the racketeering case, which is set to proceed to trial in the Port Elizabeth High Court in November. The state says Blignault headed up a perlemoen syndicate which made millions of rands through the fishing, cooking, packaging and then exportation of the product. It emerged during Blignault s highly contested bail application in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court that while unemployed, Morne Junior paid R1.45-million in cash for his home in Kragga Kamma Road. In addition to driving a flashy car, extensive renovations were apparently done to his house, which was now valued at more than R3-million.
