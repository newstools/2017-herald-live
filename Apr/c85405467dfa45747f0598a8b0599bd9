Picture: Fabian Smith The NMMU-Madibaz Football Club have laid down a blueprint for their future and the first priority will be to successfully negotiate the playoffs for the Safa-Eastern Cape Motsepe League in June. This comes after Madibaz emerged triumphant in the SAB Regional League last weekend, taking an unassailable lead on the log with four matches remaining. It is the latest step in a strategic plan for football at the varsity, which Madibaz manager Mark Tommy said had the ultimate objective of securing National First Division (NFD) status for the team. Qualifying for the National First Division would be a first for the varsity, he said. Winning the SAB Regional League is a huge step in the right direction. It all forms part of the plan to establish a Madibaz Football Academy and, ultimately, National First Division status. He said Madibaz had regularly proved themselves as one of the top teams in the Port Elizabeth Football Association league, recently winning the title twice in three years. This gained them entry into the SAB League the next tier of regional soccer for the 2015-16 season and they have now secured the title in their second year. Winning the SAB League gives us the opportunity to contest the playoffs for the Motsepe Provincial League, which is the next step in the Safa promotional league conduits, Tommy said. Besides the Motsepe League playoffs, Madibaz will also be targeting the University Sport South Africa football tournament in July in an attempt to qualify for next year s Varsity Football.
