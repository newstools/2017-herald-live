Trade union federation Cosatu has called on President Jacob Zuma to step down after his controversial cabinet reshuffle last week. &#8220;Cosatu no longer believes President Zuma is the right person to unite and lead the ANC &#8221; the federation&#8217;s Bheki Ntshalintshali said on Tuesday after a meeting of the Cosatu central executive committee. Zuma has sparked widespread anger including in the ANC leadership after he fired key ministers last week. Finance minister Pravin Gordhan and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas were among those who were axed. The reshuffle has worried investors and triggered a ratings downgrade from Standard &amp; Poor&#8217;s on Monday. Meanwhile Moody&#8217;s said it was considering a similar move.
