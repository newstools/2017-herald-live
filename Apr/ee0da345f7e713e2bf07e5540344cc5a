The makers of South African struggle film Kalushi are brimming with pride after it scooped the best film award at the annual Luxor African Film Festival under the theme of international freedom. Director Mandla Dube received the prestigious award from the Egyptian minister of arts and culture at the festival in the historic Old and New Kingdoms of Ancient Egypt. Dube said the award, which is named after ancient Egyptian king Tutankhamun resonated with the spirit of struggle icon Solomon Mahlangu on whom Kalushi is based. He said he was incredibly proud of the cast and crew who were overjoyed at winning the award. Dube said Kalushi would be screened at other international film festivals this month.
