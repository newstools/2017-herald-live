Jayson Juglal leaving court Picture: FREDLIN ADRIAAN Cops sent on wild-goose chase after tall story about robbery in S strand A Port Elizabeth man s elaborate tale involving robbers, him being held hostage in his upmarket flat and a missing luxury vehicle turned out to be a load of hogwash, with police discovering that a prostitute actually took the R1.4-million Mercedes-Benz and no robbery had ever taken place. The tall story backfired on the Summerstrand victim , who was arrested after he caved while being grilled by police and allegedly admitted it was all a big lie. The victim , Jayson Juglal, 55, claimed he had been attacked by two men at his flat and his Mercedes- Benz had been stolen. However, police found later that the car had been in the possession of a prostitute. They said Juglal had admitted to fabricating the story. After having diverted a number of police resources to what turned out to be a false crime report, police have warned that people making bogus allegations will be prosecuted. Juglal, who was arrested and spent Tuesday night in police station holding cells, appeared in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court yesterday and was released on R500 bail. According to police, Juglal had claimed that he was held hostage inside his 9th Avenue flat late on Monday night.
