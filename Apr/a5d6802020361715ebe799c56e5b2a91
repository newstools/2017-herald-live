Five men appear in Kempton Park Magistrate&#8217;s court in connection with a cash heist at OR Tambo airport Picture: Kyle Cowan The Kempton Park Magistrate s Court heard on Friday that thugs had approached the sister of one of the OR Tambo heist accused demanding she tell them where his cut of the money was being kept. Sibusiso Job Mnisi 39, the fifth man arrested just 10 days after the heist appeared in court and submitted an affidavit as evidence to support his formal bail application. In the affidavit he claims his sister was approached and assaulted at her Mpumalanga home by persons claiming to be police officers demanding to know where the cash from the heist was being kept. Mnisi was employed by Guardforce International a private security company that specialises in moving high-risk and valuable cargo as a maintenance worker stationed at the airport. My client denies in the strongest terms having any involvement in the crime said his lawyer Nkateko Mngadi. Mngadi further argued that the state had no tangible evidence to link her client to the crime. But senior state prosecutor Pieter Erasmus said Mnisi had confessed to the police officers who had arrested him. [He] gave a confession to police about his own role and that of his co-perpetrators. He provided cellphones to one or more of the other accused that were used during the commission of this crime Erasmus told the court. He furthermore has threatened one of his co-accused to stop cooperating with police. Mngadi said she could not argue the accusation that her client had threatened other co-accused as there was no evidence before the court in support of submissions by the court. The state argued extensively in its opposition of bail. Judgment has been reserved until Tuesday when Mnisi will appear alongside his co-accused as they too apply for bail.
