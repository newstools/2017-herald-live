The protesters some of whom were wearing ANCYL t-shirts were running amok pushing their way towards the Durban beachfront where the DA is having its anti-Zuma march. The DA supporter who was assaulted with sticks was immediately taken in a police vehicle from the mob who caused panic among some motorists as they banged their cars along the way. Other DA supporters ran for cover from the mob. Durban police had a tough time controlling the two groups of protesters who were meant to travel along separate routes. While the DA was marching in opposition of President Jacob Zuma the ANCYL group marched in support of government. The DA march was due to end at the amphitheatre on Durban s beachfront whereas the ANCYL march was meant to end in the CBD. However some ANCYL supporters diverted to get to the beachfront where they met DA supporters. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
