Anti-Ageing Tissue Salts by Margaret Roberts Margaret Roberts is a household name in this country for bringing the aroma of fresh herbs into our kitchens and homes in so many ways. From the lavender that carries her name, to the many books she has written and gardens she has created, she has made her mark in the world of natural health. She died last month, at age 79, only months after publication of her latest book, Anti-Ageing Tissue Salts, which is a little paperback advising how to use tissue salts found in nature in so many foodstuffs in an effective way to keep age at bay. In Anti-Ageing Tissue Salts she provides recipes and remedies for a multitude of household situations ranging from muesli to hot pot stew, and from haemorrhoid cream to anti-ageing juice. Apparently she studied and used tissue salts herself for more than 50 years and in this book she discusses how the 12 essential salts can fight ageing. The contents follow the successful formula she used in Tissue Salts for Healthy Living. Anti-Ageing Tissue Salts is published by Struik Nature, an imprint of Penguin Random House. It retails for about R150. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
