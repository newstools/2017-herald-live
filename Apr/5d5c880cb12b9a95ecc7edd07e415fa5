A small group of concerned citizens stood outside the Gupta residence in Johannesburg, with anti-Gupta and anti-Zuma placards on April 3, 2017 Picture: ALON SKUY/THE TIMES Amid the ongoing protests against President Jacob Zuma s controversial reshuffling of the Cabinet last week a handful of Johannesburg residents picketed outside the Gupta family compound in Saxonwold Johannesburg on Monday morning. Sandi Caganoff a Johannesburg resident who organised the informal picket via Facebook on Sunday said she was just &#8220;an anxious&#8221; citizen. &#8220;I&#8217;m not an activist. I am just a normal person. I am anxious for everyone in the country &#8221; she said outside the Gupta compound. &#8220;I kind of feel we can&#8217;t carry on like this anymore &#8221; she said. Security had increased over the weekend with one of the private security guards taking pictures of the people picketing outside as well as of their cars and car registration. The group of people picketing outside the Gupta compound never exceeded more than five while holding posters reading &#8220;Guptas go away&#8221; and &#8220;Guptas go home&#8221;. Private security called police to come deal with the &#8220;disturbance&#8221; but they left minutes later when they saw the group of anti-Gupta protesters were harmless and peacefully standing on the side of the street. Margie Pretorius who lives nearby said she had come because &#8220;you have to do something&#8221;. &#8220;I think the danger at the moment is there is no real leadership. We&#8217;re all struggling to find a unified voice &#8221; she said. Pretorius said individuals should do whatever they can. &#8220;It&#8217;s all about standing up and finding your voice.&#8221; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
