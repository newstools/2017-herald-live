STAR PLAYER: Quinton de Kock has been nominated for a host of Cricket South Africa awards Picture: GALLO IMAGES Quinton de Kock s stellar 2016-17 season could be handsomely rewarded at the Cricket South Africa awards to be held at the Kyalami Theatre on the Track on May 13. De Kock has been nominated in the categories cricketer of the year test cricketer of the year ODI cricketer of the year players player of the year award of excellence, and fans cricketer of the year. In the early part of the 2016-17 season De Kock racked up five consecutive test match 50s and played a crucial role in South Africa s 2-1 series win against Australia in Australia. In last year s portion of the season De Kock tallied 695 runs at 63.18 in eight tests and 857 runs at 57.13 in 17 ODIs. The following year was not as rich, but timely contributions of 374 runs at 53.42 in five tests and 423 runs at 42.30 in 10 ODIs represented a healthy return. De Kock s seven international centuries are a sign of his growing maturity and his ability to deliver under pressure. The bulk of his test runs came when the top order had faltered. Alongside Temba Bavuma he showed that South Africa s young brigade is well equipped for the rigours of test cricket and the pressures that come with counterpunching a team out of trouble in difficult batting conditions. De Kock will be expected to play a crucial role in South Africa s attempt to annex their first ICC trophy in 19 years when they start their assault on the Champions Trophy in two months from now His two award of excellence nominations for catches off Australia s Nathan Lyon and New Zealand s Neil Broom highlight the massive strides he has taken in his primary keeping job. While his keeping was never in doubt it was never seen as his strongest suite. However his displays behind the wicket have more than dispelled this myth.
