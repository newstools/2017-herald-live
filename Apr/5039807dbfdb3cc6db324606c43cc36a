DREAM COME TRUE: Masande, left, and Bulelani Putuzo overcame the odds to receive diplomas in agriculture Picture: Supplied A simple call for help has translated into hope for brothers Bulelani, 25, and Masande Putuzo, 24, from the Eastern Cape town of Qumbu. In 2012, former Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU) call centre operator Vatiswa Zwelibanzi took a call from Bulelani, who desperately wanted to study at NMMU. However, he did not have the money required for the application fee, let alone a year of tuition. Zwelibanzi was so moved by Bulelani s story that she went beyond the call of duty and assisted him in getting into NMMU. I saw potential in his matric results and encouraged him to apply, Zwelibanzi said. To my surprise, he sent two application forms, his own and one for his brother, Masande, who was in matric at the time. With the help of her then manager Christelle Feyt, application fees, NSFAS funding and acceptance into the NDip Agriculture programme were secured for both brothers. Bulelani took the first step by showing determination that, despite not having any money, he wanted to study, Zwelibanzi said. His cry for help touched my heart.
