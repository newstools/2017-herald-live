The race consists of a 5km and a 10km route, and both events draw women who walk, men in drag, casual joggers and runners keen to show their prowess on the road. Both races start from the grass area at Pollok Beach in Summerstrand, Port Elizabeth, with the gun going off for the 10km race at 7am and at 8am for the 5km.
