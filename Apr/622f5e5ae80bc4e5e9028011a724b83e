Lefa Mosea Picture: Kwathole Conexion Pretoria-born saxophonist Lefa Mosea has launched his first solo project, a track called Mabele, which came out last week. Mosea, 31, well known in the Nelson Mandela Bay music circles from having been a member of jazz band, Take Note, said the song, Mabele, produced by himself, Siyabulela Mdebele and Edgar Muzah, gave direction of his level of maturity but was not an indication of the sound to be expected from his upcoming album. Mabele is very different from the other tracks on the album but it s a clear indication that I ve matured as an artist, he said. The saxophonist parted ways with his former band Take Note in 2015, members he met while at NMMU studying for his BMus education degree in jazz, but said that unfortunately the vision between him and the rest of the group. Currently working on his debut album as Lefa Mosea, he said recording songs was complete and that the album was in the mixing stage. It s a delicate project. I ve taken three years to write it and worked closely with Siya. We played the material a lot to test it out, but it took way less to record it, he said. Mosea was hit by the music bug at the tender age of 13 and enrolled for music theory and guitar lessons until his matric year before being a student at the Vusi Mahlasela Music Development Foundation. He will be performing on the National Arts Festival Fringe stage from July 1 until July 8.
