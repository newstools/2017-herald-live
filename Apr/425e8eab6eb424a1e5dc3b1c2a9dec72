I WANT YOU: World Wrestling Pro chief executive Mark Beale hopes to pull the crowds at the Splash Festival Picture: Supplied Professional brawlers to entertain crowd at popular PE festival The Splash Festival returns to Port Elizabeth this weekend with World Wrestling Professionals (WWP) keen to entertain thousands of spectators in a thrilling Wrestle Monster showcase at Hobie Beach on Friday. Hosting the biggest wrestling extravaganzas in Africa and based in the city, WWP wrestling promoter Mark Beale is excited to draw thousands of South African and international spectators. WWP is also flying in six well-known international wrestlers from the famous World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) federation in the US. We are hoping to make the Nelson Mandela metro the capital of wrestling on the African continent, Beale said. The great exposure that WWP has had across the world has helped the sport to grow immensely in Port Elizabeth. Having offered the likes of Zama Kwaito Kid Njokweni a helping hand that launched his career in wrestling, Beale prides himself on his development and growth of the sport in Port Elizabeth. Beale lost a brother to an aneurysm in the ring last year, but has persevered and pushes on to change the lives of young aspiring wrestlers to a healthier lifestyle in Walmer township. The WWP has recently become involved in the Nelson Mandela Bay Pro Wrestling Academy in Walmer and takes young wrestlers through the ranks. A lot of hard work goes into becoming a good wrestler, Beale said. His developmental gymnasium will help feed fighters into the professional wrestling team. The gym focuses on amateurs and equips them with the proper training techniques, Beale said. This year s Splash Festival will include Jet Ski Nationals and games by Volleyball South Africa, among other sporting events.
