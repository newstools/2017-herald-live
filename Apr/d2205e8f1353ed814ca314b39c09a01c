Despite the noise that has erupted around her move to The Front Row Lerato Kganyago has remained calm and has no space for negativity. Just hours after it was revealed that Lerato had teamed up with Bonang Matheba to co-host the show Bonang resigned. In the wake of the major shakeup at Metro FM social media has been abuzz with split views on Lerato taking over the hot seat. But Lerato has no time for negativity and took over the reins with her held up high. In fact Lerato says she s emotionally strong and nothing fazes her. For many years I&#39;ve been bashed by black woman on twitter for GROWING and taking brave steps! Nothing new!
