Some years ago Moeletsi Mbeki, son of Govan and brother of Thabo, was reported as using words to the following effect: The African may come to look back on the colonial era as a golden age . He did not disown the statement and nothing adverse happened to him as a result. Helen Zille is now to be disciplined for stating an indisputable truth, that there were benefits that derived from colonial rule. She could have referred also to campaigns to eradicate the tsetse fly, to combat malaria, hospitalisation and reduction of infant mortality and, with reference to the then Southern Rhodesia, to a magnificent system of African education. There were others. Why the disparity in the treatment of Mbeki and Zille? It is obvious: however true Zille s statement, she is to be punished because the leaders of the DA other than Zille are terrified that black parliamentary voters will be caused by her words to say: There you are. The DA s white premier of the Western Cape is a racist. That is to be the reward for selfless service to the DA and the country, leading to the Western Cape being the national ray of hope. In it s very different way the disciplining is as offensive as the refusal of the ANC to remove from power our monstrous president and his cronies. Why don t you say so?
