Andile Lungisa. Picture: TimesLIVE Since the start of the new term, ANC councillors Andile Lungisa and Litho Suka have bunked three consecutive Nelson Mandela Bay committee meetings without formal apologies. The two, who sit on the infrastructure, engineering and energy committee, said yesterday the meetings clashed with their political work. However, they could find themselves in hot water if the trend continues. Speaker Jonathan Lawack said he would remove councillors who missed three consecutive meetings without a valid reason or formal notice. While he refused to answer questions about the two specific councillors, Lawack said he was in the process of writing to councillors who had not been attending council or committee meetings. The Municipal Systems Act is very clear if a councillor has failed to attend three council meetings or portfolio committee meetings without a formal notification, he or she stands to lose the council seat, Lawack said. Infrastructure, engineering, electricity, water and energy political head Annette Lovemore said both councillors had missed every committee meeting under the new administration. Councillor Suka has not submitted any leave of absence forms to the best of my knowledge, she said. Councillor Lungisa submitted a leave of absence for the meeting in October last year, but not either of the meetings held this year. Both Lungisa and Suka said they had missed the meetings because they clashed with ANC work.
