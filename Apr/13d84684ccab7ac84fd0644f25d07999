Police have arrested five suspects in connection with falsifying passports and work or study permits in the Addo and Kirkwood regions. An operation composed of various police units in the Uitenhage Cluster had made a major breakthrough during the evening of Thursday, 13 April 2017, and five suspects were apprehended at their homes in the Bontrug Moses Mabida area (Kirkwood) and Valencia (Addo) area. The equipment used to allegedly falsify these documents was seized and will be handed over to the SAPS Cyber Crime Unit to be analysed. Three suspects appeared in the Addo Magistrate s Court today (18 April 2017) and the cases were provisionally withdrawn awaiting the outcome of the report from the SAPS Cyber Crime Unit. Valentine Kasiyumhuru, 23, Sukolohle Tihtihtha, 29, and Shegiru Enu, 32, were released and the cases will be placed on the court roll again after the reports are received. The two suspects from the Kirkwood area (ages 27 and 29) will appear in the Kirkwood Magistrate s Court tomorrow (Wednesday, 19 April 2017). The acting Uitenhage Cluster Commander Brigadier Ronald Koll commended the team for their efforts and emphasised that the South African Police Service would remain focused and committed although the cases were provisionally withdrawn. Detectives, together with members from specialised units, will investigate these cases to ensure that the culprits will face the full might of the law .
