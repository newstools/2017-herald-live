IN TRAINING: SA U17 water polo team captain Hannah Reid, 17, and national coach Luke Manthe during a practice session at the Newton Park Swimming Pool Picture: EUGENE COETZEE The South African girls water polo team is looking to do the country proud at the EU Nations U17 Water Polo Cup to be held in Prague in the Czech Republic next week. Hannah Reid, from Pearson High in Port Elizabeth, and Elizabeth Williamson, from Kingswood College in Grahamstown, will be part of the national team to represent South Africa in the three-day competition. South Africa had a whitewash win against neighbours Zimbabwe in their recent international tour. Zimbabwe was pretty good for us, South African national U17 coach Luke Manthe said. Going up against an U19 A side helped us push ourselves to the limits against a side that is more experienced than we are. It was a very intense and competitive match compared to previous matches. Playing against older age groups puts us under pressure, but it is always nice when we come out victorious in those matches, Manthe said. We are a bit concerned about the weather conditions there [Prague]. They could affect our strategy as we are not used to playing in the low temperatures. We will need to keep moving and get the squad as fit as possible, he said. Team captain Reid, 17, said: Our team have shown good counter-attacking techniques and a mobile set of forwards, which should come in handy against the more dominant sides in the completion. The team will head to Johannesburg for a short training camp, where they will finalise their game plan before their departure to the competition on April 21.
