New Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba has set out an agenda that is unapologetically focused on using the state s R500bn procurement bill and public infrastructure spend to drive business to black enterprises and professionals. At a Saturday morning media conference, called less than 36 hours after he was appointed in Thursday night s shock Cabinet reshuffle, Gigaba made it clear that things would be very different at the Treasury from now on prompting questions about how long director-general Lungisa Fuzile would stay. The highly regarded Fuzile did not directly answer questions on Saturday whether he would see out his contract, which ends in May 2018.
