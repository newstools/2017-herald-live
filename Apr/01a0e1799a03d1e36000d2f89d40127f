Julius Malema made the point of explaining to protesters at the Union Buildings yesterday that our sovereign debt downgrade would have a deleterious effect on everyone and not only those who are perceived to enjoy privileged access to capital. It was a calculated attempt during the so-called National Day of Action to undermine Jacob Zuma s popular appeal to the poor that only his radical economic transformation can save them, junk status notwithstanding. To be frank, Malema was being overly expedient with his rhetoric because we know he likes to stick it to white monopoly capital , a bandwagon Zuma has been quick to bestride of late. The president of our country and the rapidly dissipating ANC has been desperate to shore up his support, and has painted elites and whites as enemies of his grand plans for sociological overhaul. With this message in hand, Zuma has tried to engineer unity in his party, or at least the perception of it. He has accounts. Indeed, gauging the turnout for yesterday s mass action in Pretoria, it seems the only unity Zuma has achieved is that of the opposition. Visuals from outside the seat of government showed how effectively party leaders rallied their supporters to stand in concert against Zuma. Ideological differences were put aside for the singular purpose of applying further pressure on Zuma to vacate office. For ANC loyalists, the demonstration must have prompted serious concern for its fate beyond elections in 2019. Surely only hardened Zuma cadres can fail to see the damage he inflicts each passing day. But, two years is a long way off and by then we have to wonder what credibility the party will have left to trade on? Zuma sold it a long time ago for 30 pieces of silver. Next up should be the vote of no confidence. Slowly, the screw is turning. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
