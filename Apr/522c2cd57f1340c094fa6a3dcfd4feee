Roasted Vegetables Ingredients 1 small head of broccoli, cut into florets 1 small head of cauliflower, cut into florets 1 medium sweet potato, cut into chunks or wedges (you can leave the skin on) 6 cloves garlic, unpeeled 4 baby marrows, cut into chunks 3 onions, halved, or 6 whole baby onions 3 sprigs fresh rosemary 3 sprigs fresh thyme 2 teaspoons chopped fresh parsley teaspoon salt ground black pepper cup macadamia nut oil Optional: 1 tablespoon coconut oil and punnet of mushrooms Method Preheat the oven to 180 C. Prepare all the vegetables and place in a large, shallow casserole dish. Sprinkle with the fresh herbs and seasoning. Pour over the macadamia oil, or a mixture of macadamia and coconut oil, and mix well to coat all the vegetables. Roast for 20-30 minutes. Alternately, bake at a slightly lower temperature and for longer if you wish the vegetables to be crisper. If you are adding mushrooms, add towards the end so the dish does not become watery.
