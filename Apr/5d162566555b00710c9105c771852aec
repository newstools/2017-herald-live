Spur Ironkids competitors line the edge of the McArthur pool before the start of the event s swimming section Picture: EUGENE COETZEE Congratulations to the event managers of IronKids. This event is so well organised, and the volunteers are kind, attentive, efficient and enthusiastic. From the children s point of view, many now have a glimpse of what this type of event is about. Hopefully some will become Ironmen/women. Our best Port Elizabeth weather played along to make the event extremely pleasant. The yachts in the bay formed a great backdrop and the police presence made for a very secure feeling. It s a world class event. Long may we experience these attractions to our city. Thank you to all those who made them such a success. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
