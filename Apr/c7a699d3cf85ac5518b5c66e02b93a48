I see that the Easter road death toll increased by 51% and only the Free State showed an improvement in its statistic, a reduction of 27%. I know it is probably an oversimplification to say that there was a minibus taxi involved in most of the accidents, but I don t think that I am exaggerating. In essence, I think that it is time that the taxi industry makes some contribution to fighting the mayhem and, in a lot of cases, death and destruction which some of its drivers cause on the highways. I would therefore suggest that license fees for taxis be increased by R1 000 per annum. These funds could be held in trust and used to assist relatives of people killed or injured in taxi accidents with funeral expenses, medical expenses, etc. I don t know if it is my imagination but most of the taxis seem to be Toyotas. I suggest that all the manufacturers of taxis, especially Toyota, contribute R10 000 per taxi to the RAF or to the provincial road maintenance fund. The taxis obviously provide an essential service, but they should be held accountable for the mayhem and number of accidents which they cause and/or are involved in.
