Ntsika Majiba Picture: supplied From hosting his own TV show on Cape Town TV to taking on the national screen, Eastern Cape actor-presenter Ntsika Majiba has joined Mzansi Magic s Xhosa drama series, Isikizi. The East London actor made his debut on the series on Monday. Majiba said yesterday that at first he was nervous about shooting with the star-studded cast, but he had been blown away by the love and respect they had for each other. The cast includes Chris Gxalaba, Tina Jaxa, Zandile Msutwana, Phakamisa Zwedala and Zikhona Bali. Majiba said the opportunity to audition for Isikizi came after he wrapped up his Cape Town TV talk show, Chat with Ntsika. It was God s perfect timing because I was asking myself, what next? My agent told me about Isikizi and I went to audition for the role of Mvezo, he said. He hopes the storyline will start conversations. We need the spirit of ubuntu back in our communities. Majiba said with Isikizi airing on Mzansi Magic, he will be working on the second season of his talk show on Cape Town TV. Catch Isikizi on Mzansi Magic channel 161 on Mondays at 8pm, with repeats on Sundays at 9pm. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
