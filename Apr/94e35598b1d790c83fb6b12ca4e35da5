A new exhibition by Port Elizabeth artist Rina Badenhorst opens on Monday evening, May 2, at the GFI Art Gallery in Park Drive. Dr Chris van Wyk will speak at the launch of Aleppo Life in the Rubble of Destruction, which will then be open to the public from May 3-31. Badenhorst is renowned for her expressionism focusing on shapes and shades of light and colour. She considers herself a colourist where light and colour, content and form, reign supreme. Her precision in form and balance shows in the subtleties of those shapes and shades that bring to life the precarious marriage of relationships, both in the painting itself and in the portrayal of life it depicts. Here she chose the egret as the symbol of the exhibition depicting Aleppo Life in the Rubble of Destruction. The paintings tell the story of a Syrian family and the impact the war had on them. She chose the egret (or heron) for this exhibition as a metaphor to tell the story of ordinary people caught up in the pain and suffering of the political conflict in Aleppo. The opening is at 6pm. Gallery hours are Monday to Friday from 10am to 4pm and on Saturday and religious holidays from 10am-1pm. Inquiries: Robyn Sherwood, (041) 586-3973.
