South African Airways suffered significant financial losses when it had to cancel 50 flights on Wednesday. This came after members of the South African Cabin Crew Association (Sacca) protested outside SAA s offices at OR Tambo International Airport over their international meal allowances working conditions and minimum rest periods. Sacca secretary-general Mpho Moikangoa said it was trying to rectify practices its members had experienced over the past six years but had so far been unsuccessful as SAA management was unwilling to negotiate with the union. Members of the union felt they deserved the same meal allowances pilots received. On Wednesday SAA was granted an interim interdict by the Labour Court, which meant Sacca members who make up roughly 85% of the airline s cabin crew had to return to work. Moikangoa however said the union was planning to challenge the interdict. Our legal team is looking at the merits of the interdict. We are going back to court [today]. SAA spokesman Tlali Tlali said SAA hoped it would reach an agreement with the union. Tlali could not quantify the airline s financial losses, saying only they had been significant. Our planned flight schedules have resumed and while operations are geared to full service recover y we remain exposed to minimal operational delays he said.
