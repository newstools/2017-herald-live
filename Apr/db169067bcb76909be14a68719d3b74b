A 60-year-old woman and a toddler died when their shack in Nzotoyi Drive in Kuyga, Greenbushes, caught alight early yesterday. Police spokesman Warrant Officer Alwin Labans said the victims were identified as Xolisa Ntamo and 18-month-old Ayola Ntamo. An inquest case is under investigation, he said. A preliminary investigation suggests that a Bunsen burner being used inside the shack set something flammable alight. Attempts by residents to rescue the victims were unsuccessful. Labans said it was believed Xolisa was the toddler s grandmother who looked after the child. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
