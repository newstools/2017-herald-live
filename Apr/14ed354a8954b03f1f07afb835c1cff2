Drug bought two vital weeks to help little fighter Aino survive Six months of prayer, a mighty fighting spirit and Viagra have been credited for the miraculous survival of a tiny 26-week baby, born weighing just 650g. Tomorrow little Aino Entle will finally go home with mom Thandi Msizi-Mbete, 28, and dad Mcebisi Mbete, 32. Born on October 5, her name Aino is Finnish and means the special one. Thandi said yesterday: She came into the world saying: I am here to stay . Cute little Aino was seen yesterday sporting a tiny mohawk as nurses had to shave the side of her head so they could insert drips. Her hair suits her attitude, Thandi said, laughing. She is amazing. She has the strength of an elephant. There were some days that this little person was stronger than we were, Mcebisi said. In September Thandi s obstetrician became concerned that her baby, then only 24 weeks along, was not growing well. I had pregnancy-induced hypertension and preeclampsia, she said. She was too small to be born yet, so Dr [Pieter] Marais started giving me Viagra. It worked for me and for the baby. Viagra dilates the blood vessels. However, when Aino was 26 weeks, Marais had to perform an emergency caesarian when Thandi s condition took a turn for the worse.
