Twitter users reacted with mixed emotions after the first episode of Uyanda Mbuli s reality show aired on Wednesday night with many viewers saying it did not live up to the hype. Some fans took to Twitter to express how they were not impressed with the show while others said they did not want to be hasty in their judgement deciding to wait for the second episode before making any decision. Uyanda took to Trending SA to explain why her debut show might not have done so well, saying that she used the first episode to show her fans where she comes from, so that they will understand her better. There are mixed feelings about it. Other people asking if [the show] is a documentary or reality show but I had to put [it in] perspective and context. You won t be able to understand the person if there s no context she said. Here are some of the reactions: https://twitter.com/Karabo Stoux/status/849714081250586624 https://twitter.com/Boitumelo o/status/849705592117764096 https://twitter.com/arnold phiri1/status/849722000998354945 We all starts somewhere guys.
