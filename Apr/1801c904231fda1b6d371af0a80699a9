The ANC is holding a press conference regarding the outcome of the extended National Working Committee meeting as well as the notes that were &#8216;mistakenly&#8217; sent last night. The leaked minutes of the ANC National Working Committee suggest it is mobilising around President Jacob Zuma to support him. The minutes in bullet form also suggest that ANC leaders who met yesterday want to silence any opposition within the party and are unhappy with criticism of Zuma that dominated Ahmed Kathrada&#8217;s funeral. The minutes criticise the SA Communist Party and trade union federation Cosatu who spoke out against Zuma&#8217;s leadership and the party&#8217;s Integrity Commission which called on Zuma to resign in December.
