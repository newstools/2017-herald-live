Chippa United striker Rhulani Manzini is pleased with the new weight on his shoulders ahead of his team s Nedbank Cup game against Polokwane City at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium tomorrow (3pm). Manzini, who just returned from injury, has been tasked with scoring the necessary goals to help Chippa progress to the next stage of the tournament. This is after the Chilli Boys top goal scorer, Lerato Manzini, was suspended. Lerato has been ruled out for the game against the Rise and Shine after he was handed a red card during the team s 4-1 league defeat to Cape Town City on Monday night. He will also be out for Tuesday night s league match, also against Polokwane. The former Bloemfontein striker has scored six goals for the Port Elizabeth-based soccer side in the league so far this season. Rhulani is trailing a goal behind, having netted five. He said he was pleased to be back training with the team. I am looking forward to the game. We have been training very well, he said. We didn t do well during the week against Cape Town City so we are trying to rectify our mistakes for the weekend and make sure that we go to the next round of the Nedbank Cup. We play them [City] again on Tuesday and we also want to do well there and get the three points. Although up for the task at hand, Rhulani said scoring goals for the team was everybody s responsibility at the Chilli Boys champ. Lerato s being out is a loss to us but there are other strikers as well who are capable of doing the job myself, David Zulu and Katlego Mashego. I do not think there will be a problem. We will definitely score during the game and progress to the next round. My ambition is to finish the league as the lead goal scorer of the team and the PSL as well.
