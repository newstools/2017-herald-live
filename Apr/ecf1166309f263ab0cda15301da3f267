VICTORY DIVE: Union s Kyle Sparks scores the winning try against Muir at the weekend Union High s first team beat Muir College 21-20 in a thrilling rugby encounter at the weekend. After trailing for much of the 70 minutes, Union managed to claw their way back into the match and emerged winners by one point. The Union team started brilliantly with what could be their try of the season so far when Ikhona Koeberg finished off a counterattack from inside Union s own 22m. Muir soon scored a try of their own to add to an earlier penalty. After the break, Union s Ross Stanley scored the team s second try when the backline executed a set piece to perfection. Union then allowed Muir to score shortly after this which saw them take a six-point lead. Some gutsy defence kept Union within reach and seemed to frustrate the opposition. Union were down 20-14 deep into the second half when Kyle Sparks went over to score a well-constructed team try. Matt Harpur held his nerve from the touchline to kick what proved to be a match-winning conversion. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
