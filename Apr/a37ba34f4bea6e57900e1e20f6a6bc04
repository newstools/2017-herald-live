More than 30 SAA flights have been cancelled as cabin crew members continue to strike Picture: Eugene Coetzee Thirty-two South African Airways flights were cancelled by noon on Wednesday as the impact of the strike by cabin crew members was felt on the eve of the MayDay long weekend. This is up from the six that were reported by SAA in the mid morning when aircraft departing from coastal cities early on Wednesday morning were impacted. SAA said the cancelled flights included 28 domestic three regional and one international flight. The airline said the required number of cabin crew members were currently not available to enable SAA to operate all of its flights. The strike action follows a notice of industrial action by one of the labour unions representing its cabin crew members the South African Cabin Crew Association (SACCA). Options were being considered on how to accommodate passengers affected by the cancellations. The airline said it would provide further updates on what options were available to its customers. These included combining some of the cancelled flights to minimise the impact of the delays customers would experience as a result of flight cancellations.
