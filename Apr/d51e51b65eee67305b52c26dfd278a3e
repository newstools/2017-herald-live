The Randburg Magistrate&#8217;s Court on Wednesday heard that the woman who stabbed her six-year-old stepdaughter 19 times continued her actions even when police fired warning shots. The 25-year-old woman from Diepsloot cannot be named to protect the identity of the child. She is facing charges of attempted murder and malicious damage to property. The state is opposing bail. The investigating officer Sergeant Abraham Thipe said the woman who was arrested at the scene stabbed the child in full view of police officers and other witnesses. &#8220;The suspect stabbed the child even when the police begged her to stop. The police had to break the window to save the child.&#8221; Thipe said it would not be in the interests of justice to release the woman on bail as the community is angry. In her affidavit the woman said she intends to plead guilty as she has no &#8220;valid excuse&#8221; for her actions. She told the court that she is a mother to four children and is studying primary healthcare. Pleading for her release the woman told the court that she is not a flight risk and does not pose any threat to the public. &#8220;I am a student and a mother therefore there is no chance that I will evade the trial &#8221; her affidavit reads. The bail application continues. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
