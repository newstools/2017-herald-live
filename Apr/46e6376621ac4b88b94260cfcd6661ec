Patriotic Alliance Provincial Leader Marlon Daniels Picture: EUGENE COETZEE Patriotic Alliance councillor Marlon Daniels will have to answer for stopping work at two construction projects in Port Elizabeth s northern areas. Daniels refused to allow contractors to continue working on civil works projects in September and earlier this year after he discovered a large majority of workers were not from the wards where projects were being carried out. At a roads and transport committee meeting yesterday, the ANC argued that Daniels had contravened the code of conduct rules for councillors. Committee chairman Rano Kayser encouraged ANC councillor Ncediso Captain to lodge a formal complaint against Daniels. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
