President Jacob Zuma Picture: JAMES OATWAY / REUTERS President Jacob Zuma has assured South Africans that the ANC is not going to &#8220;steal government things&#8221; through its radical economic transformation policy. He was speaking on Saturday at the University of Zululand where an event commemorating activists who died during political violence in the 90s was held by the ANC in the region. Steering clear of controversial issues including the downgrading of the economy and a call for a vote of no confidence in his leadership Zuma spoke mostly about the party&#8217;s drive to bring about radical economic transformation in the country. &#8220;All we are saying is that everyone should support it and no one should get more share of the economy compared to others. Some people say we want to steal government things through radical economic transformation even people whom I trusted &#8221; he said. Earlier in the day Zuma received a vote of confidence from ANC KZN leader Sihle Zikalala who said no party member would vote against Number One. Zuma also took a swipe at opposition parties saying: &#8220;I know there are people who were sent to parliament to represent people. But they are now causing disruption&#8230; They now have a right to insult us because of freedom.&#8221; -TMG Digital/TimesLIVE Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
