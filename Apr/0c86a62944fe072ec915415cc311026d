The laptops of three Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality public health officials were confiscated at their homes late on Friday by the city&#8217;s Metro Police and internal audit division. NMB mayor Athol Trollip said the municipality had identified a number of allegedly irregular payments and invoices in recent months. &#8220;This is particularly in the public health direcrorate,&#8221; he said. Trollip said this also resulted in the suspension of a municipal employee late last week which prompted city manager Johann Mettler to retrieve the municipal laptops. &#8220;The new government in Nelson Mandela Bay has already committed to stopping corruption and fraud. All municipal officials, elected representatives and contracted service providers found guilty of fraudulent or corrupt activities will be internally charged and prosecuted,&#8221; Trollip said. He said any corruption identified would also be reported to the police. &#8220;We are now moving into a new phase of investigations into serious allegations of corruption in various directorates.&#8221; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
