Trade union federation Cosatu is expected to clarify its stance on President Jacob Zuma s controversial cabinet reshuffle today. The Congress of South African Trade Unions held a special central executive committee meeting yesterday to discuss among others the implications of Zuma s cabinet reshuffle. Cosatu criticised Zuma s appointment of former home affairs minister Malusi Gigaba as the Finance Minister, saying he was not the right person for the job, because he lacked a background in economics. Gigaba is no economist. We need to bring more progressive economic thinkers into that institution, federation spokesman Sizwe Pamla said. Gigaba is not going to formulate policy. He is going to provide political leadership to people who are in charge of analysing the global economic situation. Look at the people who have been there at Treasury, and look at how that institution transformed those people. They came in understanding what the ANC and the alliance partners were saying but when they got to the institution they were transformed into components of neo-liberalism themselves. The South African Communist Party described Zuma s reshuffle as reckless on Friday. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
