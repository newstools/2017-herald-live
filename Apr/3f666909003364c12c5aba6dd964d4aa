The government is using an alleged robbery attempt near a boutique hotel in Houghton Johannesburg to justify providing taxpayer-funded protection for presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma. According to the Sunday Times, Police Minister Fikile Mbalula confirmed the incident but would not say whether that was the reason the state is providing presidential bodyguards to Dlamini-Zuma. Yet neither the manager of the 10 2nd Avenue hotel nor a security guard on the premises knows anything about the incident. This is despite the fact that there were said to be as many as six armed assailants involved. The report said this will add fuel to critics claims that Dlamini-Zuma is being given preferential treatment in the run-up to the ANC s elective conference in December. She is tipped to contest the ANC presidency against Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa and has the support of her former husband President Jacob Zuma the newspaper said.
