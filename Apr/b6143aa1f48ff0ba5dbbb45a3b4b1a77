The Nigerian-born musician, whose real name is Udo Jacob Esuene, said his video for the track So Many was recorded in 2015 and features Eternal, a Nigerian artist who works for MTV-Base Africa. We shot the video for So Many here in Port Elizabeth and I worked on it and now it is the official launch of the music video. The video features some sexy ladies playing around in sexy underwear. The song is a feel-good song you can listen to whenever you feel like having a good time and is about that hip-hop lifestyle we aspire to have, Ciza said. Ciza said he wrote his first song when he was just 10 years old in his father s bathroom. He said he was always into music and poetry but, coming from a non-musical family, he was scared to explore it initially since my dad was a soldier . I was scared of disappointing people so I decided to hold back and go to flying school because my dad was also a pilot in the military. He was a brigadier in the general army, Ciza said. Ciza, who has made a name for himself shooting high-quality music videos that showcase the beauty of the Bay, has done so again in the new video, which was shot in three different locations around the city. The video was shot at Gondwana, El Greco and Isango Gate. It was filmed in 2015 but I took my time editing it, he said. No stranger to the local music scene, Ciza has worked with artists such as MXO, Viv Bozack, Slyso from Umhlobo Wenene and even shared the stage with international superstar Busta Rhymes at the 2009 Saturday s Bay Summer Concert. Ciza s videos can be viewed on Youtube. For more information on the video launch, contact Ciza on 073-557-6560. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
