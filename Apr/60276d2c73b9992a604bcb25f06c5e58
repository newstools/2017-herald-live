The Presidency has denied that renovations at the expense of taxpayers are being undertaken at President Jacob Zuma s private homestead in Nkandla. We also wish to underscore that no government department including the Department of Public Works will be permitted to renovate any of the President s private houses in Nkandla spokesman Bongani Ngqulunga said. This comes after a report in the Sunday Times indicating that millions more would go towards refurbishing Zuma s homes. It was reported that the Department of Public Works had confirmed the new upgrades to the president s private homestead and that they would run into the millions. Nkandla has been subject to public scrutiny in the past for upgrades worth R246-million. The DA has sworn, meanwhile, that not another cent of taxpayers money must be spent on Nkandla. DA leader Mmusi Maimane said yesterday the party rejected any new or further upgrades, regardless of how they were described or categorised by national government. Maimane said Zuma must reject at once any plans by the government to use public funds to renovate refurbish or upgrade any property at his homestead. As things stand corruption charges pertaining to the previous Nkandla upgrades have yet to be instituted 1 131 days after I laid such charges in terms of the Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act 12 of 2004, Maimane said. Until such time as these charges have been investigated and those found guilty of wrongdoing are held to account any talk of further upgrades is outrageous. If Jacob Zuma wants refurbishments and upgrades he must pay for it out of his own pocket. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
