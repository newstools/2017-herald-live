A police constable was shot in the leg in an ambush during which a suspected robber on the police s most wanted list was shot dead in Kwazakhele yesterday. The attack happened shortly before 5pm in Ngqondela Street, where two men attempted to rob two constables of their firearms. Constables Nceba Takayi, 43, and German Makhanya, 37, were in the area to deliver a death notice to a family when the attack took place, police spokesman Captain Andre Beetgte said. As Takayi was preparing to enter a house, two armed men approached and pointed a gun at Makhanya, who was still in the street, Beetge said. The two suspects robbed him of his firearm. The pair also fired shots at his partner [Takayi] and he was wounded in the right leg. Takayi returned fire and alleged robber Lungile Mjolweni, 28, was killed. The other attacker, who was not identified, fled the scene. Takayi was later admitted to hospital. The police later recovered Makhanya s firearm and that of the dead man. Beetge said Mjolweni was on the police s most wanted list for crimes committed in the Motherwell area on March 10, including robbery and a hit-style murder.
