I am aware about their operations working in safe houses to undertake operations against the minister of police he said. I am aware of them and I am coming for them Mbalula said. He warned that the illegality in the country must come to an end. We don t allow rogue police officers using state resources to undermine the state. We can t allow that he said. Those illegal operations you are undertaking in safe houses those safe houses must chase criminals and not chase law abiding citizens. I am not going to allow that he said. You must chase criminals. I want criminals behind the door (in jail). You are working 24 hours to do an illegal operation we are not going to allow that. The law is protecting me and I am going to unleash the law to ensure that I achieve the mission to deal with rogue elements masquerading as intelligence officers doing rogue things in this country he said. Mbalula fired warning shots at those he deemed to be rogue elements saying he was coming after them with the full might of the law behind him. He warned there is a new sheriff in town and that he was there to uphold the law. &#8211; TMG Digital/TimesLIVE Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
