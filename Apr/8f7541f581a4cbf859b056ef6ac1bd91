Politics has reached a climax in this country and our democracy has never been tested like this before. The ANC is facing a mammoth challenge of trying to convince the nation that it is still fit to govern this country. I m trying to find a reason why the people want to revolt because of the cabinet reshuffle. Everybody knows that it is the prerogative of the president to appoint or dismiss the cabinet ministers and there is no crime committed by him as far as I know in this instance. The people who should be unhappy are members and followers of the ANC, so why are the opposition parties protesting? There is also this cabal galvanising support to oust the president of the ANC and the country. This reshuffling is an internal matter and if the members of the party are not happy with Jacob Zuma s choice of cabinet ministers, there is a protocol that needs to be followed within the ranks of the party. Why should opposition parties dictate who shall be in the cabinet? We should also remember that the ANC wants to implement its programme, and that needs a new team and new ideas for a particular programme. People are scared of change and their view mustn t be clouded by their hatred of the president. If they want to remove him, they should look for another reason. It s high time that the ANC should stamp its authority to show it is in power and capable to govern this country into a better life for all. Aluta continua.
