The National Union of Metalworkers of South Africa (Numsa) has called off a nationwide strike by bus drivers after accepting a 9% wage offer. It said it had to accept this sell out deal for the sake of industrial peace and stability in the sector&#8221;. Labour Minister Mildred Oliphant announced on Friday afternoon that the bus strike was effectively over as the majority of unions had reached an agreement but Numsa said it would continue with the strike. However in a statement on Saturday it said that following extensive consultations with member regions in all nine provinces it had decided to end the strike in the bus passenger sector. Despite being the second biggest trade union in the sector we had to accept this sell out deal for the sake of industrial peace and stability in the sector and we therefore urge all our members to return to work said Numsa general secretary Irvin Jim. He added that it would take time for all the union s members to return to work. We expect that by Tuesday all our members should be back at work.&#8221; Jim also warned employers that the union would not tolerate any victimisation of its members for participating in the strike. Numsa will continue to pressurise the Department of Labour to do proper oversight in the bus passenger sector. The fact that our members even under the new wage agreement will continue to be exposed to dangerously long hours without compensation is shameful Jim added.
