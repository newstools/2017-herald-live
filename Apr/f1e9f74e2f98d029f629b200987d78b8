South African Football Association (Safa) president Danny Jordaan and his chief executive Dennis Mumble are in the US and they are believed to be shopping for a new Banyana Banyana coach. The SA women s senior national team has been without a full-time coach since Dutchwoman Vera Pauw resigned in August last year following a disappointing showing at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games, where the team failed to get out of the group stages. Banyana suffered two losses against China and Sweden and their draw against hosts Brazil did not matter as they had already been eliminated from the tournament. Former Banyana midfielder Desiree Ellis, who was appointed as caretaker coach soon after Pauw s departure, said she was continuing in that capacity until told otherwise by her employers. I can t comment on that issue I am continuing with the mandate that I have been given to help the team on a caretaker basis she said. Two weeks ago I was in East London to watch a tournament of young girls and I am continuing to carry out the job that has been assigned to me. For more information about the full-time coach of this team, you must speak to the powers that be at Safa. The US women s national team remains one of the best in the world. They are currently ranked second on the Fifa rankings after Germany. They have a strong league and college system that has produced top quality coaches. Before they departed for the US Mumble said they were going to re-establish relations with the US Soccer Federation, among other things that would benefit South African football.
