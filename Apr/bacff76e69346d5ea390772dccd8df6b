Hundreds of Eastern Cape police members have found themselves on the wrong side of the law in the past three years for criminal activities including rape, murder, corruption, drug trafficking and torture. Since 2014, the Independent Police Investigative Directorate (Ipid) has probed criminal cases against 651 police members, with many found guilty and dismissed. Among the rogue men and women in blue were six officers from Komani (Queenstown), who have recently been fired after working hand-in-hand with drug dealers and gangsters by transporting and selling narcotics. This was said by Eastern Cape commissioner Major-General Liziwe Ntshinga when she addressed the Bhisho legislature s safety and liaison portfolio committee yesterday. Ntshinga and a provincial police delegation of top brass had to account for how they were dealing with inadequately equipped and under-staffed police stations, fleet management and to prevent firearm thefts from some stations. Ntshinga said in the 2015-16 financial year, 315 cases involving police were reported to Ipid. The number fell by nearly half in the 2016-17 period, with 165 cases. Civil claims against the police were on the decline, she said. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
