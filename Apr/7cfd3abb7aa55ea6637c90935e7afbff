As if one Du Toit in the Stormers set-up was not bad enough for opponents coach Robbie Fleck will unleash Pieter-Steph s younger brother Johan on the Lions this weekend. The crunch Super Rugby match at Newlands sees a potential first cap for the talented flank who replaces the injured Cobus Wiese in the squad. Nizaam Carr who was on the bench during last week s 34-26 win over the Chiefs at Newlands will start in the No 6 shirt in Wiese s absence with Johan du Toit on the bench. The 21-year-old is a large flank measuring 1.95m and weighing 108kg. Johan is similar to his brother in that he has a massive work ethic and work rate Fleck said. He gets across the park and he also gives us a lineout option from the bench. Pieter-Steph returns to the starting lineup after missing the Chiefs match with a knee injury. Scrumhalf Jano Vermaak is back in the starting lineup after missing last weekend due to concussion while Dewaldt Duvenage is given a rest. Godlen Masimla moves on to the bench.
