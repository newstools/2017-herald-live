It left Wenger in turmoil after his team s fifth defeat in their last eight league games. With many supporters again demanding Wenger resign, the toxic atmosphere around the north Londoners boiled over as fans refused to give the ball back to Gunners right-back Hector Bellerin when it went into the away section in the second half. Instead, they berated Bellerin and his teammates with chants of you re not fit to wear the shirt , with the Spaniard having to be consoled when he was jeered again at the final whistle. Wenger and his squad were targeted for more abuse when they left the dressing room to go to the team s bus. Arsenal s shocking surrender leaves them in sixth place in the Premier League, lagging seven points behind fourthplaced Manchester City. With Wenger s record of leading Arsenal into the Champions League for 19 consecutive years in severe danger, the beleaguered Frenchman acknowledged he had to find a way to avoid the mutinous mood wrecking what may yet prove to be his final season in charge. Faced with the prospect of missing out on the Champions League for the first time since 1997, Wenger has not helped his cause with the uncertainty over his future.
