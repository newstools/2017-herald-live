An open letter to mayor Athol Trollip and deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani, Enough of the infighting and disruption ( Trollip, Bobani tensions flare up at meeting , March 31). We all at some time have had to work with people that we do not get on with, but you are part of a very important coalition and compromise is needed. If that is impossible, which your body language suggests, then maybe you should once again go to your respective leaders and ask, for the sake of the metro, that you be replaced by people who will sit down like grown men and talk to each other, and act like responsible politicians. Do not expect any help from the EFF unless it suits its political ideals. The ANC is completely fractured, so use that to your advantage. A lot of good work has been done, but you are walking a very fine line, and cannot afford grandstanding and risk losing this metro. Also Rory Riordan, when you suddenly reappeared in our lives with your friend, Danny Jordaan, all you have contributed is your usual gibberish. Jordaan obviously had no interest in the metro once he was no longer mayor so much for his commitment to the poor! Please will you follow in his footsteps and go back from whence you came for you have nothing positive to say and are superfluous to this metro s needs.
