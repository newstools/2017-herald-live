The ANC Youth League in KwaZulu Natal has threatened to &#8220;squeeze out&#8221; former finance minister Pravin Gordhan&#8217;s efforts to rise up against the ruling party. Addressing the media on Monday morning the league&#8217;s provincial chair Kwazi Mshengu warned that the organisation would challenge Gordhan on his declaration that he would mobilise against the ANC. Former finance minister Pravin Gordhan on Saturday encouraged mass mobilisation &#8220;to ensure that the people shall govern&#8221; in the wake of President Jacob Zuma s much maligned Cabinet reshuffle that saw him and his deputy Mcebisi Jonas fired along with several other ministers. &#8220;Pravin can&#8217;t mobilise society. Otherwise the ANC would have been dominating in Chatsworth and Phoenix. &#8220;This is the ANC Youth League. We will squeeze out Pravin Gordhan. He has failed to mobilise for the ANC. How will he take on such a powerful organisation?&#8221; Mshengu said that the league would not physically fight Gordon and his supporters or disrupt events but would urge members to support its policy frameworks and the beliefs of the party. &#8211; TMG Digital/The Times Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
