Southern Kings head coach Deon Davids Picture: Supplied Expectant Southern Kings head coach Deon Davids feels his exciting back division have the ability to strike at any moment against the Melbourne Rebels tomorrow (7.30pm). Davids was speaking when he named the Kings team for what promises to be a hard-fought clash against a Rebels side at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium. The Kings have made only one change to the starting lineup which scored a stunning Super Rugby win over the Waratahs in Sydney last week. In a rotational change, Davids has named Martin Bezuidenhout as hooker, while Michael Willemse, who starred in the win over the Waratahs, will provide backup on the bench. The Kings have scored 27 tries in their opening eight Super Rugby matches and are determined to improve on that tally against the Rebels. We enjoy playing with the ball in hand, and I am obviously excited at seeing these guys. I think the way Louis Schreuder and Lionel Cronje are directing the play at this point in time is very good and creates opportunities, Davids said. I think with just a bit more communication, and more time with ball in hand, I believe we can strike at any occasion with the pace that we have on the outside. It s exciting to see the guys starting to gel and getting a better feel for each other after the past three weeks. Hopefully, the ball will stick a bit longer in our hands this weekend. Davids said his team had huge respect for the Rebels who drew 9-9 against the Sharks in Durban last weekend. You don t go to Durban and get a result like that easily. They are a quality side and it is going to be tough and we need to be ready, he said. As a team, we just want to play good rugby. We enjoy wearing the Kings jersey and there is a lot of pride at this point in time. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
