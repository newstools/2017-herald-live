With Eastern Cape roads expected to be overflowing with traffic over the Easter weekend, Transport, Safety and Liaison MEC Weziwe Tikana has cautioned motorists travelling longer distances to make sure they were well rested. In fact, she even wants them to take a rest during their trip, after every 200km on the road. She was speaking on Wednesday afternoon during a mass memorial service for five people who were killed when their vehicle overturned between Cala and Lady Frere on Friday last week. While investigations have not been concluded as to the cause of the accident, one of the probable causes might have been fatigue, Tikana said. It is important to rest on the road, and when travelling a long distance, there must be two drivers taking turns to drive. On Wednesday, Tikana urged commuters to report any violations or risky behaviour from taxi and bus drivers. She said high traffic volumes were expected on different routes and warned that law enforcement officers would maintain high visibility. Roadblocks will be set up in strategic points, she said. Meanwhile, Eastern Cape police have also issued a warning to citizens to be alert, saying criminals always looked for an opportunity to enrich themselves during this period. Acting provincial police commissioner Major-General Andre Swart said they had crafted a plan to ensure increased police visibility and crime prevention operations.
