Mayor Athol Trollip yesterday unveiled a mayoral gallery honouring the five post-apartheid mayors who preceded him. Trollip said the five all of whom ruled on the ticket of the ANC had demonstrated a common patriotism and commitment to eradicate poverty. I want to pay tribute to them because they laid the foundations of democracy and made this administration s job much easier. None of the five former mayors arrived at the ceremony at City Hall, although all of them had been invited, Trollip said. I m disappointed but I understand to an extent. By mid-morning the DA-led Freedom Day rally in Vuyisile Square outside the hall had drawn a sea of people in blue DA T-shirts. The new mayoral gallery, which features Nceba Faku, Nondumiso Maphazi, Zanoxolo Wayile, Ben Fihla and Danny Jordaan, complements the pre-1994 one. Trollip said he had realised change to the gallery was required when he became mayor. There was nothing reflecting the post-liberation leadership, yet these were the pioneers of our democracy. Of the former mayors who could be reached for comment, Fihla confirmed he had been invited to the unveiling but said he had had other Freedom Day commitments. Wayile said he had not received an invitation. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
