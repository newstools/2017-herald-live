Emma Ellis, left, battling it out with Christy Woolmington during the Battle Rounds on The Voice SA Nelson Mandela Bay singer Emma Ellis lives to fight another day after she won her Battle Round against fellow The Voice SA contestant Christy Woolmington in Monday s episode. Ellis, 21, from Summerstrand went up against Woolmington from Johannesburg whose voice was described in the Blind Auditions as child-like by the judges and admitted that she thought Woolmington would take it. She s amazing and when I heard I was up against her, all I could think of was the musical theatre experience she has. I was terrified but also confident in knowing that I was going to give it my all no matter what, Ellis said. Coach Karen Zoid who had one Battle Pair in this week s episode, gave her two singers Christina Aguilera s ballad Beautiful to Sing which was a fitting choice as both singers were struggling with believing in their own abilities throughout rehearsals ahead of the show. Zoid advised her talent before going on stage and told them real is the new perfect . Ellis said it was a bit of a shock hearing she had to do a Christina Aguilera song. It s not at all a song I would normally do, but I was excited to try something different . The former Pearson High School pupil who is no stranger to reality music shows, having made it to Theatre Week in Sun City for Idols SA is loving her experience on The Voice and added it s like nothing I ve ever done before. It s been such an unreal experience and I can t wait to see what s lying ahead . Ellis said she was excited about the next part of the competition the Knock-Out Rounds. #TeamKaren is taking it this year I m sure of it. The winner of season two of The Voice SA will walk away with R250000 cash from Dialdirect, Samsung products, a Subaru Impreza 2.0 Premium CVT and a R100000 Truworths fashion voucher. &lt;blockquote class=&#8221;instagram-media&#8221; data-instgrm-captioned data-instgrm-version=&#8221;7&#8243; style=&#8221; background:#FFF; border:0; border-radius:3px; box-shadow:0 0 1px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.5),0 1px 10px 0 rgba(0,0,0,0.15); margin: 1px; max-width:658px; padding:0; width:99.375%; width:-webkit-calc(100% &#8211; 2px); width:calc(100% &#8211; 2px);&#8221;&gt;&lt;div style=&#8221;padding:8px;&#8221;&gt; &lt;div style=&#8221; background:#F8F8F8; line-height:0; margin-top:40px; padding:62.5% 0; text-align:center; width:100%;&#8221;&gt; &lt;div style=&#8221; background:url(data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAACwAAAAsCAMAAAApWqozAAAABGdBTUEAALGPC/xhBQAAAAFzUkdCAK7OHOkAAAAMUExURczMzPf399fX1+bm5mzY9AMAAADiSURBVDjLvZXbEsMgCES5/P8/t9FuRVCRmU73JWlzosgSIIZURCjo/ad+EQJJB4Hv8BFt+IDpQoCx1wjOSBFhh2XssxEIYn3ulI/6MNReE07UIWJEv8UEOWDS88LY97kqyTliJKKtuYBbruAyVh5wOHiXmpi5we58Ek028czwyuQdLKPG1Bkb4NnM+VeAnfHqn1k4+GPT6uGQcvu2h2OVuIf/gWUFyy8OWEpdyZSa3aVCqpVoVvzZZ2VTnn2wU8qzVjDDetO90GSy9mVLqtgYSy231MxrY6I2gGqjrTY0L8fxCxfCBbhWrsYYAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC); display:block; height:44px; margin:0 auto -44px; position:relative; top:-22px; width:44px;&#8221;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;p style=&#8221; margin:8px 0 0 0; padding:0 4px;&#8221;&gt; &lt;a href=&#8221;https://www.instagram.com/p/BSvcaZcBpxb/&#8221; style=&#8221; color:#000; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; font-style:normal; font-weight:normal; line-height:17px; text-decoration:none; word-wrap:break-word;&#8221; target=&#8221;_blank&#8221;&gt;Summerstrand&amp;#39;s Emma Ellis lives to battle another day after she won her Battle Round against Christy Woolmington on The Voice SA yesterday #emmaellis #emmaellisofficial #pegems&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p style=&#8221; color:#c9c8cd; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px; margin-bottom:0; margin-top:8px; overflow:hidden; padding:8px 0 7px; text-align:center; text-overflow:ellipsis; white-space:nowrap;&#8221;&gt;A post shared by My Herald Live (@myheraldlive) on &lt;time style=&#8221; font-family:Arial,sans-serif; font-size:14px; line-height:17px;&#8221; datetime=&#8221;2017-04-11T10:13:55+00:00&#8243;&gt;Apr 11, 2017 at 3:13am PDT&lt;/time&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;script async defer src=&#8221;//platform.instagram.com/en_US/embeds.js&#8221;&gt;&lt;/script&gt; &nbsp; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
