A senior Nelson Mandela Bay traffic officer has been arrested on a charge of bribery. Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said Xolela Mtsatse, 51, was arrested at about 4.30pm on Tuesday following a sting operation. It is alleged that the traffic official wanted R200 from the complainant in exchange for not writing out a traffic fine and returning the motorist s driver s licence, Swart said. The exchange took place at Queen Mary Crescent in Uitenhage and the traffic official was subsequently arrested by the police. Mtsatse appeared in the Uitenhage Magistrate s Court on Wednesday morning and was released on a warning. The case was postponed to May 24. Uitenhage station commander Brigadier Laurence Soekoe said: The arrest proves that there are consequences for unethical and unprofessional conduct by law enforcers and the South African Police Service is committed to ensure that all cases of corruption and bribery are investigated thoroughly.
