Khanyi Mbau Picture: Instagram/Khanyi Mbau Metro FM listeners are in for a few surprises, the SABC confirmed with the start of its annual reshuffle of radio presenters yesterday. Khanyi Mbau would get her own show while Lerato Kganyago teamed up with Bonang Matheba on The Front Row as co-host, SABC spokesman Kaizer Kganyago said. The news came just hours after 5FM s DJ Fresh took over the reins as Metro FM s new Breakfast Show host yesterday with Somizi Mhlongo as his co-host. Kaizer said the changes on the radio station were not new and happened every year. I know the word reshuffle is a good word to use as with the current news in our country but the changes at Metro are no surprise. They are changes we effect for a new financial year the only difference is that we have not shared them publicly first as we usually do he said. It was the radio station s strategy to surprise listeners with the changes and Metro FM was therefore coy to reveal much detail about future plans. You need to listen to the Metro that s how you will know what is going on, he said. That is our strategy to keep our listeners engaged. Celebrity Khanyi declined to comment on her new show. Till I get confirmation, I am not allowed to comment on Metro FM, or have anything else to do with the national media Khanyi said. The changes come in the wake of Glen Lewis s resignation from Metro FM to join digital online radio station Touch HD. This was followed by Unathi Msengana s departure on Friday, after a decade at the station. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
