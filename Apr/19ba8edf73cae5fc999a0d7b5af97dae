Scotty G will perform at the Savoy Theatre tonight Bay hip-hop and rap artist Scotty G is launching his new CD, Face of the Moon, at the Savoy Theatre tonight. The album was produced by Hein Bosman of HB Studios and is Scotty G s first album as a solo artist. I am a bit nervous but truly humbled to share my songs with the world, the artist, whose real name is Scott Geduld, said. I m sure the messages in my songs will resonate with a lot of people. The songs are introspective and personal. It goes back to me growing up on the Cape Flats and my move to Port Elizabeth. Both provinces played a vital role in my writing and the making of my CD, he said. The promising young artist has performed at music festivals including the Northern Arts Festival, where he was a finalist in the Sky is the Limit talent competition. He last won the PEgotbars event a rap competition founded by Bosman. Scotty G moved from the Cape Flats to the Bay with his family in 2011. He discovered his love for beats during his school years and combined it with his love for the piano and writing lyrics. It was during this creative process that he also discovered his talent as a poet. Scotty G s dream is to tour South Africa and ultimately internationally, and to become a top producer. Tonight s launch at the theatre at the corner of Diaz and Stirk roads starts at 7pm and Scotty G will also perform original material from the album. Admission is R50 and the CD will be on sale at R80. Inquiries: Selwyn Milborrow, 071-869-9292. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
