Picture: Supplied Two men were arrested for allegedly attempting to hide about R158 000 worth of dagga in the bushes on the N9 between Uniondale and Willowmore. Phillip Sambok, 34, and Mbeka Camagu, 33, both from Thembalethu in George, appeared in the George Magistrate s Court this morning on charges of dealing in dagga. Police spokesperson Captain Malcolm Pojie said the bust was made yesterday by members of the vehicle inspection section and provincial traffic department, who were doing routine roadblocks along the road. Pojie said they spotted a Mercedes Benz with tinted windows travelling on the N9 towards to George which stopped alongside the road before doing a U-turn. They pulled the car with two occupants over, and with the search that ensued they found a bag filled with dagga in the vehicle. Clues inside the vehicle urged the members to expand the search further along the route. This extended search led to the find of six more bags with dagga that were dropped off at the point where they made the U-turn. Pojie added that some of the men s personal belongings were also found near the bags. The dagga, weighing about 79.2kg, was confiscated, as well as the Mercedes Benz. Pojie said the dagga was destined for distribution in the Southern Cape area. We shall increase our vigilance and visibility on our main entrance and exit routes to the province to eradicate the influx of illegal substances such as dagga which contribute to the commission of other serious crimes, he said. The case was postponed to 26 April for the Provincial Detective s Organised Crime team to investigate. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
