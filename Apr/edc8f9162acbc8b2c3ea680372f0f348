UNDER SCRUTINY: Charmoney Hector Woman allegedly kept pregnancy quiet, later claiming it had been a stillbirth, writes Kathryn Kimberley A young Port Elizabeth model has appeared in court for murder nearly three years after she secretly gave birth to a baby boy and then allegedly placed him in a plastic bag before calling the emergency services. The striking Charmoney Hector, tall and slim, stood quietly in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court yesterday as magistrate Sanjani Naidoo explained the seriousness of the offence to her. This is a very, very serious offence, Naidoo gently explained. But because Hector, 23, had cooperated with the police, even providing them with DNA samples, the magistrate said she was prepared to release her on bail of R1 500, on condition that she not interfere with any of the state witnesses. Investigating officer Detective Warrant Officer Deon Hanekom said that on May 9 2014, the then 20-year-old Hector had called the emergency services, claiming she had given birth to a stillborn baby. When the officials arrived at her residence in Mount Croix, she handed them the baby in a plastic bag, Hanekom said in his statement. Hector, a part-time model and pageant winner, allegedly kept her pregnancy a secret. Hanekom said further investigations and an autopsy report showed the baby had allegedly been born alive.
