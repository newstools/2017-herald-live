DJ Fresh After more than a decade on 5FM, DJ Fresh has described his move to Metro FM as a 30-year-long dream come true . Fresh will take over the reins as Metro FM s new breakfast show host from today and said he was ready for the journey ahead. Speaking live on 5 FM, the radio veteran said he was told about moving to Metro late last week and had grabbed the opportunity. It was a no-brainer, but it was also bitter sweet, because I have a family here [5FM]. I ve built a family for 11 years. Fresh said that after being in the industry for so many years, he felt he owed this to himself. For me, in a selfish kind of way, I feel I owe myself this. Fresh took a trip down memory lane to recount his journey on 5FM, which included how, before he joined 5FM, it was his goal to host both drive time shows on the station. When I was at Y FM, I was building towards that. And I have done that and I feel like, it s time to move on, it s time for new blood. Fresh recalled how he had had nightmares about messing up for the first three months on the station. I had nightmares every night about messing up on 5FM. But, for Metro I am more excited. There is zero fear. It s a 30-year-long dream and, like I said, for me it s important to do this, he said. Fresh s resignation on Friday afternoon came just hours after Metro FM morning co-host Unathi Msengana announced that she was leaving the station. The news also came a week after former Metro FM breakfast show host Glen Lewis announced his exit from the station to join Tbo Touch s internet radio station Touch HD. The SABC declined to comment, saying it would make all announcements about its new lineup within the next few days. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
