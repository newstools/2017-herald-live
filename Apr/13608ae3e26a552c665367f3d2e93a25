Controversial Nigerian pastor Timothy Omotoso arrived at the Port Elizabeth airport shortly after 3pm this afternoon [20/04/17] where he was arrested by a large police contingent. Omotoso, 58, allegedly sexually abused scores of young women. &nbsp; &nbsp; Shortly before his arrival defence advocate Terry Price, who was waiting for his client at the airport, got into a verbal argument with member of the Hawks as he question whether they would be arresting the pastor. Omotoso was handcuffed and escorted from the airport by a number of police officers. Earlier today it was confirmed that top Port Elizabeth defence attorney Alwyn Griebenow will represent Omotoso. Griebenow confirmed that he was Omotoso s attorney and that he and Price would be meeting with the Hawks. Omotoso arrived at the Hawks premises in King Edward Street, Newton Park, shortly after being escorted from the airport. While reports were circulating that Omotoso was planning to hand himself over to the Hawks, Griebenow said his client was only meeting with police. He is not planning to hand himself over. The police have not indicated that there is a warrant of arrest. He will meet with them later but it is only an interview, Griebenow told The Herald. The Nigerian evangelist came under scrutiny after his church featured on current affairs programme Special Assignment on Sunday. The programme spoke to women who claimed that they were lured into performing sexual favours for the pastor. &nbsp; &nbsp; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
