Much has been written about Super Rugby of late with regard to the 18 teams being reduced to 15 teams, who those teams will be and why, the impact the loss of Super Rugby will have on the Eastern Cape, strength versus strength, etc. First up though, is Saru once again proving to rugby-loving South Africans that they are a bunch of incompetents and that nothing has changed with Oregan Hoskins leaving the executive and Mark Alexander now being the head incompetent. I say this as once again Saru is of the belief that Eastern Cape rugby is a ball to be rolled around like by a dung beetle in different directions, going nowhere fast. One year EP are in the Currie Cup Premier Division and the next year not. This is the cradle of black rugby, where the vast majority of black rugby Springboks, Blitzbokke and even our Bok coach (I say that lightly and tongue in cheek) come from. Saru s job is to nurture and grow rugby, not to stuff it up as it is doing in the Eastern Cape. On to Super Rugby. There are currently 18 teams playing Super Rugby and not all being on a par with one another. Therefore, why not split up the teams into an A and B division, with the A division being, say, the top three teams in New Zealand, the top three in South Africa, the top two in Australia and A N Other, possibly the Jaguares? The other nine teams play in the B division, and at the end of the season, the top B division team gets promoted to the A division and the bottom A division team is demoted to the B division. This ensures strength versus strength all the time, it ensures full stadiums as each team will play 16 games (home and away) and does away with the ridiculous local derbies. This will also ensure a slightly shorter Super Rugby season, allowing for a proper Currie Cup season, and will also ensure that the Currie Cup returns as the local premier rugby competition.
