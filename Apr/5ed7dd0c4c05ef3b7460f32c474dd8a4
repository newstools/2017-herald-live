PAYING RESPECTS: Prince William, Duke of Cambridge, lays a wreath before the &#8220;Service of Hope&#8221; Picture: GETTY IMAGES Queen Elizabeth s grandsons, princes William and Harry, joined relatives of four people killed in a deadly attack near the London parliament two weeks ago for a Service of Hope yesterday. Khalid Masood, 52, ploughed a car into pedestrians on Westminster Bridge, killing three people and injuring dozens before running through the gates of parliament and stabbing a policeman to death. He was then shot dead. British police have said it was a terrorist attack, but Masood appeared to have been acting alone. Families of the victims US tourist Kurt Cochran, 54, college worker Aysha Frade, 44, retired window cleaner Leslie Rhodes, 75, and constable Keith Palmer, 48 joined Harry, William and his wife Kate for the service at Westminster Abbey, a stone s throw from the scene of the attack. The violent assaults have shocked people everywhere, John Hall, the Dean of Westminster, said. Those killed and injured included Londoners but also people from the United States, Romania, France, South Korea, Italy, China, Australia, Greece, Portugal, Germany, Poland and Ireland. The congregation included those injured in the attack along with witnesses, those from the emergency services who were first on the scene and representatives from major religions. William and British Home Secretary Amber Rudd gave the readings and London mayor Sadiq Khan delivered one of the prayers. Investigators say Masood, a former violent criminal who had converted to Islam, had become self-radicalised by accessing extremist material on the internet. Nothing had linked him to radical groups.
