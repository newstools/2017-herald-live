A gunfight between police and suspected gangsters yesterday afternoon [13/04/17] saw two people arrested, one of who was nabbed at hospital after being shot in the stomach. The shootout stems from a tip-off of four men with firearms inside a house in Meralda Street, Helenvale. &#8220;As police entered the house, they noticed one person throwing a firearm into an adjacent room. A .22 calibre Astra pistol and three rounds of ammunition was found,&#8221; police spokeswoman colonel Priscilla Naidu said. &#8220;The 26 year old was arrested on a charge of illegal possession of a firearm and ammunition.&#8221; Naidu added that when police stormed the house, another man began to flee. &#8221; Police members chased after the suspect on foot and when he entered an alley, he started firing at the officers. Police retaliated by returning firing . The suspect jumped over a wall and escaped. However, police believed that the suspect may have been shot.&#8221; Within an hour the 20-year-old was found at a local hospital with a gunshot wound to the abdomen. &#8220;He was arrested and detained on a charge of attempted murder. The man will remain in hospital under police guard.&#8221; Mount Road Cluster head Major General Funeka Siganga welcomed the arrest. &#8220;Such attacks on our officers will not deter us from executing our duties in ensuring the safety of our citizens in the Northern areas of Port Elizabeth,&#8221; she said.
