Roger Federer beat Rafael Nadal in the Miami Open Picture: Scott Barbour / Getty Images Roger Federer defeated long-standing rival Rafael Nadal 6-3 6-4 to win the Miami Open yesterday, continuing his outstanding start to the year. Since returning from his six month injury lay-off, Federer, 35, has also won the Australian Open and Indian Wells and he heads into the clay season once again as the dominant presence on the ATP Tour. Federer has beaten Nadal in all of those events this year and has now won his last four meetings between the pair. It s been a fabulous couple of weeks, Federer said after his victory. The Spaniard was playing in his fifth Miami final but remains without a win in the Masters series event. The first set was a tight affair with both players having their opportunities to break, but it was not until the eighth game and 10th break point of the set that one of them was able to get ahead. Nadal could only find the net from a Federer backhand and the Swiss grabbed a 5-3 lead. He held the next game to secure the first set. Federer pinpointed his saving of break points in the first game and at 3-3 as crucial moments in the contest. It was totally key, Federer said. He looked good from the get-go. A bit more luck on his side, the wrong decisions by me and it could have turned very quickly. It was very intense. There has always been a marked contrast between Federer and Nadal s differing styles and with time it has become further accentuated. Nadal was working hard in the afternoon heat, thrusting himself into his shots while the elegant Federer s poise appeared almost casual. The second set took an almost identical path, albeit with fewer openings to break until Federer again pounced, to grab a 5-4 lead when Nadal went long returning a fine backhand.
