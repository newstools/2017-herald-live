Nakhane Toure plays Kwanda in &#8216;The Wound&#8217; Picture : Tshepo Kekana South African film The Wound has added to its resounding international success with a multimillion-rand distribution deal in France. The film s producer, Elias Ribeiro, said the deal with French distributor Pyramide Films also helped the movie get publicity in several major publications and on billboards in the country. He said the deal was worth a whopping R2.5-million. As part of the deal the film has been released at 41 cinemas across France and is expected to pull in an audience of more than 50 000 moviegoers. Lead actor Nakhane Toure said he was humbled by the reception it had received. It is insane. It is humbling to hear how the film has done so well in France, he said. I thought when I took the role that it might be a small independent film that would soon disappear but it is a beautiful piece of work that was done so well. The Wound tells the story of Kwanda a gay factory worker who travels from the city to the rural area of his family s origin to be circumcised in a traditional rites-of-passage ceremony. The film which will be released in South Africa later this year will be distributed to 19 countries including the US and the UK.
