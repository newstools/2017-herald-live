Since 2003, pupils and teachers from Helene-Lange School in the German town of Oldenburg in Lower Saxony have had a successful exchange programme with Westville High, Gelvandale High and Sanctor High, and now also with Willow Academy, which joined last year. The programme is aimed at educating pupils about the importance of green energy. Over the years it has benefited pupils and teachers at the Port Elizabeth schools, with solar panels and a small wind turbine assembled at Westville and Gelvandale high schools respectively. Now 15 pupils and four teachers from Helene-Lange are back in Port Elizabeth to launch a solar lamp project with Sanctor High and Willow Academy. The pupils attended workshops this week where they assembled the solar lamps, using various components bought in Germany.
