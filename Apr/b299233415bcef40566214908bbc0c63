Godfrey and Doreen Thompson celebrate 60 years of marriage today Picture: Mark West Port Elizabeth lovebirds Godfrey and Doreen Thompson are celebrating their 60th wedding anniversary today at their home in Arcadia. After a chance meeting at a bus stop in Willow Road, Fairview, in 1957, Doreen Ressouw, now 82 and Godfrey Thompson, now 85 dated briefly before he asked her dad for permission to marry Doreen. Fast forward 60 years into married life and the Thompsons are still happily married, with four children, eight grandchildren and nine great grandchildren. Asked how they have sustained their marriage for so long, Doreen and Godfrey said We never pray without each other and are still doing things as husband and wife . According to the Thompsons, one of the key elements to sustaining a marriage was not to involve third parties . Never ever get a third party involved in your problems. Couples should listen to each other. The husband should listen to his wife and the wife must wife listen to her husband. We have never slept in separate rooms even after arguments. But most importantly, never do things without your partner, they said. Doreen and Godfrey had an early celebration last Sunday, surrounded by their closest friends and family at their family home in Arcadia.
