DJ Euphonik DJ Euphonik has stepped up the offensive in the war against drugs and plans to personally help an addict get off the streets and into rehab. This week Euphonik announced an initiative to give hope to those who are struggling with drug addiction. I am always looking for opportunities to do random acts of kindness and often I am led to people I can help through other people. &#8220;Recently I was speaking to a guy who told me about the difficulties of getting someone into rehab so I decided to help Euphonik said. He said that booking someone into rehab could cost as much as R120 000 making it difficult for someone who might need it the most. Often poverty prevents people from getting help. So I will sponsor the entire process from them booking to rehab to their recovery afterwards he said. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
