A building was on fire in Braamfontein on Tuesday afternoon. Johannesburg EMS spokesman Synock Matobako said he and other paramedics were rushing to the scene at around 2pm. What we know is that the Braampark is on fire. We are not quite sure whether there are any people trapped in the building he said. A police helicopter could be seen above the area with police sirens wailing in the background. It was unclear what had sparked the blaze. Flames could be seen inside the building from the top floors of the twin tower like structure. The buildings close to the office park were being evacuated. I am evacuating the building right now as we speak Isaac Mangena spokesman for Oxfam SA said. The building which had caught alight housed the SA National Blood Services and Nedbank Mangena said. It is just behind the iconic Johannesburg Theatre. Other companies which are in the same office park are Old Mutual and the SA Human Rights Commission.
