SABC3 revealed the brand s new positioning The Stage Is Yours last week as it announced its refreshed lineup and new shows to the channel at a glamorous event held in Melrose Square, Johannesburg. Next month will see SABC3 introducing a reality slot at 7.30pm from Mondays to Wednesdays with drama on Thursdays and Fridays. Tuesdays and Thursdays, at 8.30pm, the channel will introduce a magazine strand and on Fridays the movie feature returns. SABC group executive for television Nomsa Philiso, said audiences only came to the channel if the content was right and that depended on what it received. We&#8230;need to start being serious about the performance of our programmes. I mean it when I say programmes that are not performing cannot justifiably hog space on the channel, Philiso said. Safta-winning presenter Anele Mdoda s show Real Talk with Anele, moves from 4pm to 5pm, swapping time slots with Afternoon Express . Head of Bouquet Aisha Mohamed said SABC3 was looking at launching great new properties on the SABC3 prime time schedule for this year. For viewers who are globally aware but have their hearts firmly rooted in South Africa, the channel is shining a spotlight on progressive spirit. We are excited to hand the stage over to represent their dreams and aspirations, Mohamed said. Marking the 25th anniversary of Top Billing, Philiso said the lifestyle show would remain a key pillar of the channel and announced BET-A-List presenter and model Ayanda Thabethe as a new face on the show. Other new shows coming to SABC3 include Follow the Leader hosted by financial expert Farnoosh Torabi; The Hostess with Lorna Maseko; Driving in Heels presented by motoring journalist Vuyi Mpofu; We Meet Again; Adventure Capitalist; Dinner Date; Tyres and Braaiers; reality show Uyanda: It s On following the life of socialite Uyanda Mbuli; Thula s Vine and many more.
