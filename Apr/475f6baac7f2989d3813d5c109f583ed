Eight people have been arrested and 24 stolen police firearms recovered since a brazen heist at the Peddie police station last month. The arrests come less than a month after a gang broke into the station strongroom through the roof and stole 30 police firearms. While police remain tightlipped about the arrests and investigation, they confirmed that several suspects had been taken in for questioning leading to eight being arrested. The storeroom register showed that 12 R5 assault rifles, 12 handguns and six shotguns were missing after the burglary. The latest bust was on Wednesday night when the provincial investigation team followed a tip-off that led them to a firearm stash hidden in a municipal dustbin in the East London area. Two R5 assault rifles, two shotguns and five pistols were found inside the bin while further raids led to another two firearms being recovered. Detectives suspect that one of the firearm buyers lives in the Buffalo Flats area in East London. On Wednesday, Luxolo Mgoqi, 25, Ntombizethu Stuurman, 43, Siphelo Voyi, 33, Samora Mali, 30, Thandile Dayimani, 25, and Zimela Xhanti, 21, appeared in the Peddie Magistrate s Court on charges of illegal possession of firearms as well as burglary. Police have declined to name the other two men until they have been formally charged in court. Provincial police spokeswoman Brigadier Marinda Mills said the investigation had already taken detectives as far as Cape Town, where one person was arrested.
