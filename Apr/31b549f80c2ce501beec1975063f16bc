&nbsp; Popular Durban televangelist Timothy Omotoso will spend the next 12 nights behind bars after the matter was postponed to 3 May 2017 in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court this afternoon. Wearing the same patchwork jacket he was arrested in, Omotoso, 58, appeared in court today following his dramatic arrest at the Port Elizabeth airport yesterday. He is charged with two counts of human trafficking and two counts of sexual assault. The Nigerian televangelist is a senior pastor of Jesus Dominion International, whose headquarters are in Durban, with a Port Elizabeth branch in Govan Mbeki Avenue. As the controversial pastor appeared in court, congregants from his Port Elizabeth branch marched and prayed outside. Earlier today, protesters gathered outside the courtroom, calling for him to be denied bail. Dramatic scenes played out at the Port Elizabeth Airport yesterday when a popular Durban televangelist at the centre of sex-abuse claims was handcuffed in the restroom and arrested for human trafficking minutes after his flight landed.
