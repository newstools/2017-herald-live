There had to be a measure of pride rising in the breasts of every well-meaning South African at the events that unfolded last week. There was peace, unity and joy among many of the participating citizens in the protests. They came from all races and backgrounds. I do believe great things are destined for our nation, if we can merely look past the darkness to the light beyond. We are all cared for by an awesome and powerful God. As Christians all over the world prepare for the very important event of Easter, one that brings healing, as we relive Jesus triumphant victory over sin and death, as he rose from the grave three days after his crucifixion, we are promised, if we are willing to participate, we die to the old sinful self and rise in newness with him. He is true to his promise and in our hour of need all obedient South Africans can enjoy the one true vestige of hope, that he will never leave us or forsake us.
