Water supply will be disrupted in the southern parts of Port Elizabeth on Wednesday due to repair work that has to be done on a pipe. The areas likely to be affected include Summerstrand, Walmer 1st Avenue to 7th Avenue, South End, Humerail, Humewood and Forest Hill. The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality s spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said they could not finish the repair work which they started last week Wednesday due to the pipe being in worse of a condition than anticipated. [There are] holes underneath and near to the bedrock which is difficult to weld. It is also difficult to prepare for the repair as we can t see the pipe without having the water off as the trench fills up with water too fast to enable us to see anything. We are, however, busy manufacturing a large special joint that we will bolt around the affected [pipe], Mniki said. He said the water supply would be cut between 7am and 2pm. Mniki apologised for the inconvenience. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
