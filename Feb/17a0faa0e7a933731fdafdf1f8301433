Internationally recognised Maxhosa by Laduma fashion designer Laduma Ngxokolo is presenting a series of business talks from next week starting with his home city of Port Elizabeth on Saturday, February 25. The series, Laduma Design Talks, is being presented in conjunction with Chivas Regal for free around the country but prospective participants need to register, and the deadline is Monday, February 20. Although Ngxokolo has made his mark in the field of fashion with innovative knitwear based on his Xhosa heritage, the invite is open to all creatives. If you have an existing brand, business or credible creative idea, then Laduma Design Talks is looking for you, as Ngxokolo hopes to uncover talent and nurture designers to a successful career. The questions you need to answer yes to are: Do you show passion in and understanding of your design specialist field? Are you a struggling entrepreneur or facing business growth challenges caused by limited access to resources? The Laduma Design Talk is from 9am to 4pm on Saturday, February 25, at the Rooftop Garden Bar in Chapel Street. There will be an opportunity for networking from 5pm until late. Candidates need to submit a written or recorded motivation for inclusion in the programme. This must include your CV and five product images of your work.
