&#8216;The Incredible Journey&#8217; Next month s literary festival in Knysna will explore not only the world of books but also encourage youngsters to tell their own stories through a production of The Incredible Journey: The Making of a Hero on the theatre component of the annual programme. Part of the 2017 Pam Golding Knysna Literary Festival, the play to be performed at Knysna Primary School on March 16 is aimed at tweens and teenagers between the ages of 10 and 18 and focuses on the different dimensions of bullying. Three actors take the whole family on a dramatic adventure of song, dance and imagination to show their audience the importance of reading, as well as how a hero is made. The Incredible Journey received one of the Standard Bank Ovation Awards at the 2015 National Arts Festival in Grahamstown, signaling it is likely to be a quality production. Tickets are R10, available from the Pam Golding Property Office at 5 Grey Street in Knysna. The office is also encouraging donations of old but loved books, to be passed on to the town s Concordia High and Primary schools, as well as sponsorship for a child to attend the theatre productions. The literary festival runs from March 16-19 and hosts well-known South African authors, poets and performers from both the fiction and non-fiction genres. There are small-group workshops, as well as larger group presentations. For more information, e-mail info@knsysnaliteraryfestival.co.za.
