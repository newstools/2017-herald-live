Pieter-Dirk Uys brings Evita Bezuidenhout to the Boardwalk Amphitheatre Entertainer Pieter-Dirk Uys, also known as Afrikaans socialite and self-proclaimed political activist, Tannie Evita Bezuidenhout, is in town this week for a comic State of the Nation Address follow-up at the Boardwalk Amphitheatre. Pieter-Dirk Uys will be bringing the fabulous female to the Amphitheatre at the Boardwalk for An Evening with Evita from Thursday to Saturday at 7.30pm each night. For over 30 years, the character of Evita has been part of the lives of all South Africans, addressing often-sensitive and topical issues with humour and grace. She has posed as everything from the Embassadress of the fictitious Bapetikosweti to a kugel who addressed apartheid in a rather controversial manner. This week she will be an honourable member of the ANC in her all new State of the Nation Address . Fans can expect to see Evita focus on women and address the state of family values in the show, encouraging audiences to remember their roots in order to embrace and celebrate where they are headed. Evita never uses bad language or any tasteless references, says her creator. Instead, with absolute respect, she installs hope in the future of the country and she brings across her point ever so clearly: the people must lead and government will follow. The 90-minute show has no interval. Tickets are R130 and bookings are at Computicket. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
