Former Eskom chief executive Brian Molefe will soon be sworn in as an MP &#8211; a move that is likely to fuel speculation about a pending reshuffle of President Jacob Zuma&#8217;s Cabinet. Parliament confirmed on Friday that Molefe had been nominated to &#8220;fill a vacancy on the North West list of ANC Members of Parliament which is depleted&#8221;. The Sunday Times reported last month that the North West ANC had forwarded Molefe&#8217;s name to Luthuli House. Molefe resigned from Eskom after details of his relationship with the controversial Gupta family were laid bare in the public protector&#8217;s state capture report.
