NOT PLAYING: Thamsanqa Sangweni Picture: SowetanLIVE Chippa United coach Dan Dance Malesela says their Premier Soccer League fixture against Bloemfontein Celtic tomorrow at the Dr Molemela Stadium (kickoff 3.30pm), will be a different ball game compared with that against Mamelodi Sundowns. But Malesela said his planning for the Siwelele game would not differ from their normal preparations. We do not really plan differently for matches, he said. We stick to the same routine. We play and we try to open up the opponents and we try to defend very well. The former Orlando Pirates skipper said tomorrow s league fixture would be a tricky one as teams were fighting for points in the second leg of the league. Chippa are eighth on the log, with 20 points from 16 games, while their opponents are 13th with 15 points from 16 matches. Malesela said they could not relax now as the points difference between them and the team below them was not that much. It s a tricky fixture because we are all desperate for points and also we are playing away, but we know what to expect. Chippa will be without injured striker Katlego Mashego, influential captain and midfield commander Thamsanqa Sangweni, due to suspension, and defender Bongani Kama, who is injured. Malesela s biggest headache at the start of the second stanza was to have a steady defence. The coach says he has seen some improvement in the last two games the Chilli Boys played. We tried out new people and they were good enough for us to have gotten a point. We are hoping that we will improve with time and hopefully we can get a new pairing that will prove to be enough for us to win matches.
