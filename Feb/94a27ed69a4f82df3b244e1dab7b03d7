President Jacob Zuma at the 2017 State of the Nation address Picture: Esa Alexander / The Times President Jacob Zuma says he is not bothered by the spate of insults spat angrily at him across the national assembly floor before the Economic Freedom Fighters were ejected from Parliament. He described the EFF under the leadership of Julius Malema as an angry minority in the country . Zuma ripped into his critics after the chaotic State of the Nation event during a TNA Breakfast Briefing in Cape Town on Friday. He chose his words carefully but there was little doubt that they were meant for Malema. Asked whether the SONA debacle in which he was called a constitutional delinquent was symbolic of a divided nation he laughed. Then seated in a leather chair he elaborated: We are dealing with people who have quarrels with their colleagues he said. If for an example you are dealing with an organisation that was established by young people who were expelled from the ANC they must be angry with the ANC. They must be trying their level best to fight back but they don t know how. These people he added frustrated debate yet called themselves democrats. Zuma said if he were an ordinary citizen I would have said these people must be out of parliament because they are changing parliament. They are changing the understanding of what democracy is all about. Democracy is not about angry young people. Democracy is about debating things. Debating what we need to do for our country. He said the fracas caused in Parliament does not bother me . It was no different he added to fighting against a lunatic apartheid government during the struggle. &nbsp; Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
