Veliswa Mvenya, DA Member of the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature Picture: TimesLIVE Supporters of Veliswa Mvenya have turned to social media in an effort to boost her chances at succeeding Athol Trollip as provincial leader. They have asked for ideas to be shared on how Mvenya could make her campaign a success. Writing on Facebook, DA MPL Kobus Botha urged the party s branch delegates, councillors and members of parliament to make history and vote for Mvenya. Botha described Mvenya as a long-standing and experienced Eastern Cape team leader with a solid track record of growing the party. He confirmed that he was Mvenya s campaign manager. The party is set to close its nomination period next Monday, just two weeks before it holds its provincial elective congress. Congress convener Elmarie Botha said the campaigns appeared to be running smoothly so far. There is a party campaign policy that is available for everyone, she said. We believe the campaigning has not prejudiced anyone. We have not received any complaints so far, Botha said. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
