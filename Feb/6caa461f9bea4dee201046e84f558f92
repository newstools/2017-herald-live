A Lorraine father who allegedly took explicit photographs of his twin daughters and distributed them online, was supported by his wife yesterday when he appeared briefly in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate s Court. The case against the 45-year-old sales representative, who cannot be named in order to protect the identity of his children, was postponed to March 9 for further investigation. He has not yet pleaded and is out on bail of R10 000. The man was arrested in November for the creation, possession and distribution of child pornography. According to the charge sheet, the man took nude photographs of the girls just eight years old at the time and distributed them online.
