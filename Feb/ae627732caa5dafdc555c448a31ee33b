ANC councillor Rory Riordan said they were unhappy as the suggestions they had put forward were not considered. We said we would support the adjustments budget if four things were done cut the under-spending, the ATTP [Assistance to the Poor] policy must remain as is, reduce the deficit to at least R265-million and also improve cash reserves. That has not been done, Riordan said. The budget was passed by the DA-led coalition, PA, United Front and AIC. EFF councillor Yoliswa Yako said the party believed the budget was not favouring the poor in the city. Mayor Athol Trollip said: It is regrettable we had to vote on the approval of the adjustments budget. In the past . . . we [DA and UDM] never voted against an adjustment budget, as it is simply a reassessment of the realities on the ground and a restructuring of the budget.
