EFF MPLs were barred from taking part in yesterday s state of the province (Sopa) debate at the Eastern Cape Provincial Legislature in Bhisho as a result of the clothes they were wearing. MPLs Dinga Peter and Litha Zibula were dressed in red EFF overalls, and the speaker of the provincial legislature, Noxolo Kiviet, instructed them to leave as they were dressed inappropriately. The two also received charge sheets for their refusal to leave the state of the province address on Friday. They were instructed to do so for the same dress issues and are expected to appear before the provincial ethics committee on March 1. Prior to the state of the province address, the pair approached the Bhisho High Court for an urgent interdict in a bid to stop Kiviet from ejecting them based on their clothes. We are going back to court for another application, Peter said. Our previous application was dismissed on the grounds that it is not urgent, not on the merits of the case. Meanwhile, other opposition parties continued to debate premier Phumulo Masualle s address. Opposition leader in the legislature, Bobby Stevenson, criticised Masualle for saying too little on corruption in certain municipalities. There can never be economic transformation when resources are skewed by jobs for pals, contracts for comrades and tenders for tjommies. All one will continue to get is radical corruption and looting like Mqnuma municipality purchasing 20 black plastic bags for R197 a pack, when we all know the cost is less than R30, or Buffalo City councillors claiming costs to attend bogus conferences. The UDM s Thando Mpulu criticised the Masiphathisane programme a service delivery plan saying it was not properly conceptualised.
