A closed Blue Ribbon bakery in Walmer was petrol-bombed early yesterday, with shots fired at a security guard. This comes after 50 workers protested at the company s Korsten depot in Port Elizabeth on Monday due to retrenchment packages offered by Blue Ribbon, which is part of the Premier Foods Group. The group invested millions of rands into Port Elizabeth when it launched into the regional bread market in 2014. But it is now consolidating its Eastern Cape operations and has shut down production in the city. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said three petrol bombs were thrown into the Heugh Road bakery at about 2.20am. Fortunately, nothing was damaged in the incident. However, the security guard on site was extremely shaken, she said. Naidu said an unknown number of people marched to the premises, where they fired random shots at the security guard as well as throwing the petrol bombs inside. It is suspected that they were shooting at the on-site security. However, it was very dark and details remain sketchy, Naidu said.
