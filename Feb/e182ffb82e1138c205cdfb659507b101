The deadline for applications for the Music Mobility Fund is February 26 Concerts SA s Music Mobility Fund will select new projects to support next month, with a deadline of Sunday February 26 for applications. This is an opportunity for Bay musicians who are planning a music tour between next month and June this year but are unsure how to fund it. The tour funding mechanism is aimed at offering financial assistance to professional South African musicians for live music tours in South Africa, as well as other Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries. The fund provides support to live music performances, collaborations and performance-based workshops. Concerts SA administers the fund as a joint South African and Norwegian project within the Samro Foundation and it already has gone through five rounds of funding. Samro promotes the national arts through sponsorships of various kinds, and Concerts SA works as part of this by finding and implementing ways to create a vibrant and viable live music circuit. Since it started in 2013, the Music Mobility Fund has received almost 600 applications and supported more than 110 tours with artists such as Tlokwe Sehume, Lindiwe Maxolo, Benjamin Jeptha, Wendy Oldfield, The Rudimentals and Tu Nokwe. There is an application form that must be completed. For more Further information, visit www.concertssa.co.za or e-mail concertssa@samro.org.za.
