Staff assisting Nelson Mandela Bay ward councillors have been warned by mayor Athol Trollip to either submit their time-sheets to the municipal constituency office or face not being paid at the end of the month. In a report to the mayoral committee, which met on Wednesday, corporate services officials said ward staff were refusing to submit time-sheets to the constituency services office. They were demanding that their timesheets be collected and their pay slips dropped off by a driver, as was the norm for years. But Trollip said if the staff refused to submit the documents, the department should refuse to pay them. The corporate services department recommended that a driver or messenger be hired to collect the time-sheets. The ward councillor staff refuse to bring their time-sheets to the constituency services office on time, he said. They propose that a driver [be hired] to collect time-sheets from different clusters on time. They proposed that when the driver delivered council agendas, ward staff pay slips could also be delivered. The ward staff want constituency services office officials to visit them monthly to help fill out time-sheets and leave forms. But corporate services political head Dean Biddulph said the recommendations would be amended, as the onus was on the staff to submit their own time-sheets. A memo will be issued to ward office staff compelling them to be responsible for the submission of their time-sheets monthly, on time, failing which they are going to have a problem being paid, Biddulph said.
