Barry Martin Dams will be depleted without good catchment area rainfall Nelson Mandela Bay has about 493 days worth of water stored in its five supply dams. And it is likely that the overall dam supply will drop below 50% before the end of next month if it does not rain significantly in the catchment areas. The halfway mark has been described as a critical event by the city s political head of infrastructure, engineering and energy, Annette Lovemore. The amount of water left came to light during a church service at the All Saints Anglican Church in Kabega earlier this month. Nelson Mandela Bay water and sanitation director Barry Martin stood in front of the congregation and urged everyone to pray for more water. We only have about 15 months of water left. I work for the municipality and I am here to ask all of you to pray, he told the congregation. Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said Martin s statement was correct. Should no inflow occur into the catchment dams, then the municipality will be without water in 15 months. But the estimated dates could move considerable closer as Mniki said the last 10% of water in the dams was deemed unsafe for extraction and consumption.
