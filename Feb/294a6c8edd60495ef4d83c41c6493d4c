Picture: YOLISWA SOBUWA Multimillion-rand Ocean View development now just an eyesore A R21-million multipurpose township renewal project in Jeffreys Bay has fallen into complete disrepair before it even opened its doors. The project, which first started in 2009 in the Ocean View township of Jeffreys Bay, was meant to house a creche, hawkers facility, car wash and toilets for a taxi rank. But while the project was meant to boost the township s economy, vandals have instead stolen bricks, doors, windows and taps. Graffiti has been sprayed on most of the building s walls, with weeds coming out of every crevice. The building, which was completed in 2011, was also built at the entrance of the township as a means of beautifying the area. Ocean View resident Sipho Silango, 48, a taxi driver, said people were thrilled when the project was first announced and then built. The municipality at the time said the centre would benefit the community. We don t know what happened though as the project was abandoned.
