Inger Thede will host an art talk talk at the GFI Art Gallery Swedish architect Inger Thede will be giving an art talk at the GFI Art Gallery in Park Drive on Thursday. Thede has a home in Port Elizabeth designed by the celebrated Bay architect, the late Gertruida Brinkman, who also designed the building housing the GFI Art Gallery. Taking much inspiration from Africa, Thede has promoted natural and sustainable energy and three years ago was awarded the Scania Solar Award for her well-designed solar power cells. Inger strongly believes in the importance of community involvement and we look forward to hearing about her influences and experience in our Art Talk on Thursday, a spokesman for the gallery said. Gallery hours are 10am to 4pm on weekdays and from 10am to 1pm on Saturday. Inquiries: gfi@mweb.co.za or call (041) 586-3973.
