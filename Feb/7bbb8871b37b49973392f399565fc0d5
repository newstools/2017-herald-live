These East Cape Frail Care residents will go to homes for aged, disabled Bhisho official Eighty-one of the close to 240 patients at the only two fully state- funded frail care centres in Port Elizabeth will be moved to homes for the aged and homes for the disabled. This is because the Department of Social Development has classified them as no longer in need of 24-hour care, provincial department head Stanley Khanyile has said in papers before the Port Elizabeth High Court. Khanyile filed the papers as a response to an application by the Frail Care Crisis Collective, a group of families who are trying to provisionally stop the move of patients currently housed at the Lorraine and Algoa frail care centres. The department did not renew the contract with Eastern Cape Frail Care the company running the two centres, a subsidiary of Life Esidimeni and decided to move patients into the care of nonprofit organisations at the end of last year. It was this move that was halted by a court order issued in December. Khanyile said the department had been paying more than triple the subsidies that frail care centres, providing 24-hour care, received in other provinces.
