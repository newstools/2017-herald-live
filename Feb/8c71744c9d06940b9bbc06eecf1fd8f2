Members of the metro police, the Department of Environmental Health and Ward 11 councillor Isaac Abrahams surprised Sidwell business owners yesterday when they made a snap trading permits inspection. The initiative saw the group of about 30 officials break down illegal temporary trading containers on Friday while other businesses were forced to pack up outside goods and move them inside the premises. One of the major retail outlets in the area, Springbok Butchery, also came under fire as they did not comply with the bylaws of their permit. One regulation was that they needed to make 65 parking bays available due to the size of the premises. Business owners who could not produce permits were given warnings.
