RescueCare spokesman Garrith Jamieson said 24 others treated for gas inhalation and transported by ambulance to hospital were in a stable condition. Six people die in &#8216;freak accident&#8217; at Durban s naval base &#8220;Our men should be remembered as heroes for what they did said South African National Defence Force spokesman Mafi Mgobozi. The contractors had been working on a sewer pit at the base when they were overwhelmed by gas. Our members then rushed in to try to save them.&#8221; He said the three soldiers had also been exposed to the gas adding that the investigation into the incident would continue. &#8220;We will release the names of the deceased once we have made contact with their families.&#8221; It is understood that men had been working in a partially flooded underground shaft or pit inside a disused building at the naval base according to a source with knowledge of the incident. An emergency service member who spoke to TimesLIVE on condition of anonymity said a group of workers were underground when the gas leak occurred. Earlier in the week one SANDF member died when the flatbed truck transporting a tank was involved in an accident. Then on Wednesday another SANDF member drowned while swimming in the sea off Durban&#8217;s main beachfront. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
