The shootout and car chase happened shortly before 5am this morning after a patrolling police car spotted the stolen VW Polo driving recklessly at Ferguson street, New Brighton. Three suspects, two men and a woman, were arrested while another three managed to escaped. A manhunt is underway to find the remaining three suspects who fled after the Polo crashed into a tree. No one was injured in the shooting but the police vehicle was struck by bullets. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
