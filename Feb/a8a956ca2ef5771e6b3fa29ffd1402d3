Elza van Lingen is the new Kouga mayor Picture: Eugene Coetzee The ANC caucus in the Kouga Municipality has criticised mayor Elza van Lingen, claiming she misled the council on the process of appointing a municipal manager. The interview panel, chaired by Van Lingen, opted to re-advertise the post after failing to find a suitable candidate. But ANC caucus leader Malibongwe Dayimani said Van Lingen submitted an incomplete report to councillors saying candidates did not present a convincing turnaround strategy for the municipality. She decided to re-advertise the position since her personally preferred candidate withdrew . . . her reasons to re-advertise are a nonsensical excuse. Van Lingen dismissed the claims. I did not have a preferred candidate. I also submitted a report to the council and they [ANC] were part of the decision to re-advertise. . . [as] we did not get a suitable candidate, she said.
