Emergency services parked at the scene where the attack happened Picture: Supplied The man who lets his house to the owner of the pitbulls that savagely attacked a passer-by in Rowallan Park at the weekend has opened a case of malicious damage to property, saying the gate at the house was tampered with. Christo van Meiring, who owns the house in Rowan Street where pitbull owner Marcus van Meiring lives, opened a case late on Monday. It is not known whether the men are related. The injured man is on a ventilator in Livingstone Hospital s intensive care unit and has still not been named. All three pitbulls involved in the attack were euthanised on Monday at Marcus s request. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said Christo, a policeman based at the Motherwell police station, alleged that a padlock on the perimeter gate had been found lying on the ground and appeared to have been tampered with. It was still unclear what had happened. Asked why it had taken Christo so long to open a case, Naidu said he had not given a reason. Marcus is under investigation for failing to prevent injury to a person under the Animal Protection Act. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
