A COMPREHENSIVE plan for tackling the Eastern Cape s education crisis, particularly the growing teacher shortage and infrastructure problems, should be at the heart of premier Phumulo Masualle s state of the province address today. It is the main concern of all the political parties, even though a team from the office of the premier and provincial treasury was sent to help the Department of Education last year. The department was still struggling, the parties said, highlighting pupil transport problems, a shortage of teachers, especially for mathematics and science, and low numeracy and literacy levels. The province remains at the bottom in matric results, although last year it rose from 56% to 59%. ANC provincial secretary Oscar Mabuyane said the party expected Masualle to outline plans to address the education crisis. DA MPL Bobby Stevenson said the premier must tell the people what he would do differently this year to ensure that school leavers acquired skills to enter the job market.
