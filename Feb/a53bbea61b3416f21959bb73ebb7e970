An Albany Bakery bread delivery truck was hijacked at a spaza shop in KwaDwesi yesterday. The driver, 52, and his assistant, 32, were ambushed outside the shop shortly after the truck was parked at about 5.30am. They were delivering bread when they were approached by four men with firearms, police spokesman Constable Mncedi Mbombo said. They demanded money. The driver and his assistant were locked in the truck and the suspects drove the vehicle to nearby bushes. The hijackers then fled in a brown Renault. Mbombo said the police had found the truck and the two Albany Bakery employees unharmed. None of the bread was stolen. Police are investigating a case of armed robbery.
