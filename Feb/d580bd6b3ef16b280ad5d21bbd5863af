A member of the Upstand Dogs gang has been sentenced to five years behind bars for possession of a stolen 9mm handgun with 15 rounds of ammunition. Dean Fifty Conley, 18, was sentenced in the Port Elizabeth Regional court yesterday after his arrest in April last year. Conley&#8217;s arrest was part of last year s Operation Lockdown, aimed at curbing the ongoing gang violence in the Gelvandale and Bethelsdorp areas. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said that Conley s arrest stemmed from an anonymous tip-off when he was spotted walking along Terblanche Street, Gelvandale, with a firearm. The information was immediately followed up and the suspect was spotted by police. As he saw the police vehicle, he walked into the yard of one of the nearby houses. Police noticed him throwing a firearm in the yard as he jumped over the wall of another house in an attempt to evade arrest, she said. As he walked out of the yard he was arrested and the firearm was later found after a search of the grounds. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
