Louis Rossouw is restoring the clock at the Port Elizabeth City Hall Picture: Fredlin Adriaan The dormant hands of the Port Elizabeth City Hall clock will soon be ticking over perfectly on time after almost three years of not working, thanks to a restoration process which began three weeks ago. The clock will be re-installed next week with an uninterrupted power supply to make sure it never loses time again. For a while now the hands on the east-side clock face have been frozen at four o clock, while two other sides were stuck at 8.30 and the fourth at seven. After restoration, the clock s five bells weighing between 50kg and 600kg and housed in the clock tower will be chiming along with the Campanile s 23 bells by April. The two clocks will be connected through an internet connection. Clock and bell restorer Louis Rossouw said although maintenance had been done regularly, the clock had last been cleaned properly by him in 1999.
