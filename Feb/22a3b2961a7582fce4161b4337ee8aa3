Police spokesman Captain Johan Rheeder said a case of arson was under investigation. No arrests had been made. According to Rheeder, a bag filled with stones was also thrown through the glass door of the building. Graffiti on the walls stated &#8220;ANC must fall&#8221;, &#8220;F*ck you&#8221; and &#8220;100% free education&#8221;.

She said the university would issue a statement later on Sunday. &#8220;What I can say is we condemn what happened in the strongest of terms,&#8221; said Mbabela.
