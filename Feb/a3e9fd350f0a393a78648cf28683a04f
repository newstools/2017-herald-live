Two Eastern Cape traffic officers, a driving school instructor and a municipal speaker have been arrested for corruption. Hawks spokesman Brigadier Hangwani Mulaudzi said the arrests came after a team had been tasked with investigating allegations of corruption in Eastern Cape municipalities. The two traffic officials from Maletswai Municipality in Aliwal North and the school instructor from the same area were arrested for allegedly selling learner and driver s licenses. The three suspects are suspected to have raked in thousands of rands and investigations are on-going, he said. In a separate incident, the team also pounced on a senior official at the Walter Sisulu Municipality for fraud and corruption. The suspect allegedly submitted subsistence and travelling claims using vehicle details of an unsuspecting member of the public, Mulaudzi said. All four suspects are expected to apply for bail at the Aliwal North Magistrate s Court on Friday. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
