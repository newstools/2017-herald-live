The new workers federation is on a recruitment drive to sign up a million members before its national launch next month. The conglomeration of unions, set to rival South Africa s biggest labour federation Cosatu, claims it has the support of 700 000 members. The unions forming the new federation so far include Numsa, Fawu, Sapsu, Detawu, Socrawu, Pawusa, Young Nurses Indaba, Sacawu and Napsawu. The workers federation will officially announce its new name at the national event from March 24 to 26. Union representatives were in Nelson Mandela Bay yesterday to address about 200 workers from various unions at New Brighton s Nangoza Jebe Hall. An interim regional structure was appointed and introduced to the workers. Numsa s Fieldmore Mapeto accused Cosatu president Sdumo Dlamini of selling workers out to President Jacob Zuma. Mapeto said: Cosatu was more powerful than all opposition parties combined, until Zuma saw that and complained to Dlamini. Dlamini [told] Zuma he [would] make [all] Cosatu affiliates toe the line. Numsa was booted out of Cosatu for [refusing to do so]. The main speaker was Fawu leader Linda Gqokoma, who encouraged workers to fight for the new federation. NMMU #FeesMustFall activist Sinethemba Msomi said the student movement was behind the new federation. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
