Volkswagen South Africa has reached out to small enterprises in Nelson Mandela Bay as part of its ongoing quest to strengthen its roots in the community and develop the local economy. VWSA officials engaged with a number of SMMEs at a breakfast in Port Elizabeth on Friday, hosted by the Nelson Mandela Bay Business Chamber, and a number of entrepreneurs left with high hopes of future business. WVSA division head of purchasing Tom Loafman outlined the processes SMMEs needed to follow to be included in their overall production process, or to get involved in training and development programmes that would make them more attractive to large companies. We have been here so long that we have very deep roots in the local community. Much of our products are locally produced, so we want to include local producers, Loafman said. Our big focus is reducing the amount of imported content needed to produce our products by sourcing locally. VWSA could not find a comprehensive database of SMMEs to scout for potential service providers, so they took it upon themselves to build such a database. NewBreed Trading owner Luvuyo Sineke was pleased to meet face-toface with people at VWSA to get his logistics company on their radar. There is a gap between SMMEs and big businesses that can only by bridged with face-to-face meetings. It is always easier to deal with people once you have met them in person, Sineke said.
