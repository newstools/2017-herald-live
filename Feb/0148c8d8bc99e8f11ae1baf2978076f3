A Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality employee has agreed that the failure to barricade an excavation site where a small boy drowned eight years ago was negligent but said it was not the municipality s job to ensure the safety of the area. In shifting the blame to its contractor, municipal principal technician Ian Pattinson said Consolidated Power Projects was responsible for the site, right up to completion. Pattinson took the stand in the Port Elizabeth High Court yesterday to defend a civil claim following the horror death of Althero Gaai, 8, in October 2008. Althero, who had been playing with friends, drowned after jumping into a 3.1m-deep hole on the corner of William Slammert Drive and Algoa Street in Timothy Valley, Bethelsdorp, which had filled with water due to heavy rains earlier that week. Two similar holes had been dug for electrical poles to be erected, but left uncovered pending further work. The municipality had contracted the work out to Consolidated Power Projects. It is included in the contract . . . the contractor is responsible for the supervision of the work. The municipality only takes control of the site once the work is completed and a completion certificate is signed, Pattinson said in response to questions by Advocate Albert Beyleveld SC, for the municipality. On the day of the tragedy, October 10 2008, Pattinson said, Consolidated was still active on the site.
