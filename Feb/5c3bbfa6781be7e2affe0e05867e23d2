He plays soccer has baby-sitters at his beck and call loves mud baths and has a sheep as his foster mum. He s Shawu II the 120kg baby elephant who rules the roost at the Hoedspruit Endangered Species Centre in Limpopo which has become his temporary home. He was found wandering near the animal sanctuary late last year. Lente Roode founder member of Hoedspruit said Shawu was by himself when staff found him. Nobody knows how he got left behind or why he was left behind by his herd she said. Roode named him after the Kruger Park s legendary elephant Shawu. Apart from his regular strolls and mud baths Shawu s favourite past-time is playing soccer with his trunk. The grooms just started to throw him the ball to teach him co-ordination and also to let the time go by quicker. He became so cute and plays so beautifully. It seems everyone at the centre including resident sheep Lammie who acts as a foster mother to rescued animals is showering the little elephant with affection. Like all our babies that have been in Lammie s care he follows mama Lammie everywhere. Shawu has quite an appetite. He goes through four tins of formula a day at a cost of R390 per tin. Whenever Shawu hears the curators come in he sprints towards them and eagerly takes the bottle which is a great sign. He s not on solids yet but we are investigating the possibility. Roode said Shawu is fond of all his caregivers who take turns caring for him. &#8211; TMG Digital/TimesLIVE Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
