Sudan&#8217;s President Omar al-Bashir File picture: Siphiwe Sibeko / Reuters Mmusi Maimane leader of the Democratic Alliance (DA) on Friday laid criminal charges at the Cape Town Central Police Station against several members of Cabinet the SAPS Hawks the National Prosecuting Authority and senior government officials for their unconstitutional actions in allowing warlord Omar al-Bashir to flee the country . He alleged it was a contravention of both the Rome Statute as well as a High Court Order. The party said in a statement: In light of this week s ruling confirming that the government s notice of intention to withdraw from the International Criminal Court (ICC) was unconstitutional irrational and procedurally flawed the DA believes that those complicit in the escape of Al-Bashir in contravention of a court order and international law ought to face the legal consequences . At the time President Al Bashir landed on South African soil in June 2015 he was being sought by the ICC for war crimes and crimes against humanity and two separate warrants had been issued for his arrest on the 4th of March 2009 and on the 12th of July 2010. South Africa as a participating party to the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court Act 27 of 2002 was obliged to arrest and detain President Al Bashir when he set foot on South African territory. However in contravention of the Rome Statute as well a Court Interdict compelling the government to take all necessary steps to prevent President Al-Bashir from leaving the Republic of South Africa he was allowed to leave the country on Monday 15 June 2015 flying from the Waterkloof Air Base. Referring to subsequent court actions that found the government should have detained Al-Bashir the DA said it was incumbent on them as a party that subscribes to constitutional supremacy and the Rule of Law to ensure that members of Cabinet and high ranking state officials including the head of the NPA the SAPS and Hawks are held accountable for their role in breaching the Constitution and undermining the Judiciary .
