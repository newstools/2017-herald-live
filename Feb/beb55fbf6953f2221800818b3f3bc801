The Eastern Cape Department of Health has defended the appointment of dedicated ambulance washers at the East London Emergency Medical Services (EMS) station. Disgruntled paramedics working at stations in Fort Beaufort, Alice, Cathcart and Mdantsane complained that they had to wash the vehicles inside and out themselves, while their colleagues in East London had people to do the job for them. Health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said four ambulance washers had been sent to the Vincent base by the Department of Transport as part of a project that began in 2015. The washing of vehicles in East London is done by four people allocated by the Department of Transport. This does not [alter] the fact that EMS crew members are responsible for washing their vehicles as part of their key performance areas, Kupelo said. The function was considered in the performance management development system (PMDS), he said. He said the four Vincent washers took care only of the outside of the vehicle, while the interior had to be cleaned by trained EMS staff. A week-long investigation by The Herald s sister paper the Daily Dispatch revealed dirty ambulances, a shortage of medical equipment and rundown EMS bases.
