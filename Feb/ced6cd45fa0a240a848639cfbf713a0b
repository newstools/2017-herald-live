Joint oversight committee starts inspecting sites A high-powered joint oversight committee from the social development and health departments has started inspecting the facilities identified for 239 frail care patients to be moved to. The visits, which took place yesterday, were aimed at avoiding a situation such as that which resulted in the deaths of 94 psychiatric patients in Gauteng. The joint committee is headed by portfolio committee on health chairman Xolisis Dimbaza and portfolio committee on social development chairman Christian Martin. The only two fully state-funded specialist frail care centres in Nelson Mandela Bay Algoa Frail Care and Lorraine Frail Care were earmarked for closure when the contract for East Cape Frail Care, a Life Healthcare Group company that manages the two centres, was not renewed last year. The plan was to move patients at the end of December. However, the Port Elizabeth High Court ordered the department to extend the contract. Premier Phumulo Masualle said at a media briefing before the state of the province address on Friday that the matter was being handled with great care. Health spokesman Sizwe Kupelo said he could not elaborate on the plan as the entire matter was being handled by the premier s office.
