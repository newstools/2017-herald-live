HELP NEEDED: Hillcrest Primary School parent Prilene Roussouw in front of a wall protesting against the violence Picture: FREDLIN ADRIAAN Lack of security grave threat to children s lives in Helenvale Two Helenvale schools situated in the heart of gang territory have become war zones, with three shooting incidents on the grounds in less than three weeks. The incidents have left pupils and teachers fearing for their lives, as minimal security at the schools continues to be a matter of grave concern. Meanwhile, a teacher at Gertrude Shope was left traumatised after she was robbed at gunpoint on the school premises earlier this month. Parents halted teaching for a week, demanding that the Department of Education take their call for more security seriously. Teaching resumed on Tuesday after the department agreed to employ a security guard and upgrade the school s fence. Two parents at Hillcrest Primary School, Prilene Roussouw, 42, and Sharon Komoeto,44, said they worried every day about their children s safety. The teachers are forced to lock the doors. My biggest concern is that some parents go to the school during the shootings and demand to take their children home, Roussouw said.
