A video has surfaced on social media showing what appears to be a squashed minibus taxi driving on a freeway. The video, which was shared on Twitter by Norma Mansoor, has already garnered more than 800 retweets and 500 likes. The footage shows a minibus taxi driving on the highway in a state of absolute disrepair. The formerly rectangular frame of the vehicle now appears nearly triangular as the left side of the vehicle seems to have been squashed inwards, leaving a gap at the back of the taxi. The driver s door might well be attached through prayer alone. Smoke trails behind the taxi as it makes its way along the freeway. &#8211;TimesLive Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
