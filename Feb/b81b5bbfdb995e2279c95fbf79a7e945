An elderly Jeffreys Bay woman suffered minor injuries when she was attacked inside her home in the Edenglen Retirement Village on Friday morning. Police have launched a hunt for the three suspects. Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said the woman, 77 who is not being identified as she is the complainant in the case had been asleep when the men broke into her home at the Wonderboom Crescent village. The men gained entry to the house by breaking a window. The victim was tied up and the house ransacked. They stole jewellery, a cellphone and a laptop before fleeing on foot. The neighbours heard cries for help and alerted police, Swart said. At this stage it is believed the men were unarmed and used their strength to intimidate and overpower her. Investigation was under way to establish how the men had gained access to the complex, Swart said. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
