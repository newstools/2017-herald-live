No link found yet in spate of robberies that leaves one employee shot, another beaten A woman was shot and another beaten in three separate business robberies in Port Elizabeth this week. In all three attacks, gunmen posed as potential customers to gain entry to the premises. During one of the robberies, a woman was shot in the leg and in another a woman was assaulted after she refused to hand over her cellphone. The series of incidents has prompted police to warn businesses to be vigilant. Police spokeswoman Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said in the latest incident, a woman, 41, who works for Metalman in Burman Road, Deal Party, was admitted to hospital after she was shot in the leg yesterday. A VW Polo arrived at the centre shortly after 9am. The three occupants claimed to be customers. They remained in their car in the car park near one of the onsite buildings. Two of the men then confronted a woman transporting money from the office to an office with a drop safe situated across the car park. One of the men grabbed the money bag she was carrying while the woman continued to clutch it, she said. In the standoff, one of the suspects shot the woman in the leg. After grabbing the money both jumped back into the getaway car which then sped off. Janse van Rensburg said the woman was taken to Greenacres Hospital by ambulance for treatment. The bag contained R55 000. Police on the scene confirmed that the VW Polo was fitted with false licence plates, and by yesterday afternoon had not yet been found.
