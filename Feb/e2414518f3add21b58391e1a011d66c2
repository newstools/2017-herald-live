Love blossomed threefold on Valentine s Day in Port Elizabeth yesterday when Nomasonto and Luvuyo Mbaba welcomed their triplet daughters into the world. Love really was all around at Life Mercantile Hospital s maternity unit where the three little girls dressed in identical onesies and red and white beanies stole hearts, with the nurses and midwives constantly fussing over them. A beaming Luvuyo, 43, said: It was a big surprise for us. I am very proud. Hlelolenkosi (2.18kg), Hlelokuhle (1.8kg) and Hlumanande (1.9kg) were born just after 8.30am, at 34 weeks. I am very glad that they are all healthy. It was a difficult pregnancy. I was happy to meet them, their proud mom said. Luvuyo works in Port Elizabeth but his family lives in Dutywa, where Nomasonto works for the Department of Education. The couple went to see Dr Francis Maleka last year when Nomasonto, 33, was two months pregnant. She [Nomasonto] thought there was something wrong, Luvuyo said. The doctor said no, everything was fine with all three of them. It was a big surprise and quite a shock. Maleka said mother and babies were doing very well. We didn t plan the delivery for Valentine s Day. It just worked out that way, Maleka said. Luvuyo said his five other children sons Olwethu, 22, Silindokuhle and Inga, both 19, and Amahle, 10, and daughter Akhanani, 8, were very excited to meet the new additions to the family. The grannies also cannot wait. The triplets have evened things out nicely I now have four boys and four girls, he said, laughing.
