I was referred to Livingstone Hospital by my local doctor, Dr E A Mayet, due to insufficient medical funds. Hesitantly I forced myself to visit the death trap, as it is known. To my surprise, as a first-time outpatient visitor, I was ecstatic with the medical service, and the way Dr J Hamilton, Dr Phillepe Bellester, a Sister Lalla, the ultrasound department, etc treated me. I have become a patient they care for, not just a number or another financial statistic in the eyes of other medical institutions. My story turned out to be that I have to live with the bad news. Nevertheless, thumbs up for the caring factor, the professionalism and not to mention the hi-tech equipment and cleanliness. Doctors and nurses keep the oath of duty. I can only believe in you and grow healthier, and you grow from strength to strength via Livingstone Hospital. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
