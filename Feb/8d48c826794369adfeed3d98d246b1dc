South Africans who want to know what caused the near-collapse of Eskom in the five years to mid-2015 still have to wait. The electricity supplier yesterday went back on its word to set the record straight and release the Dentons report to the public. This also means the people who were implicated in it for alleged corruption are still being protected. The utility received legal advice at the last minute that only those who had applied for the document, compiled by law firm Dentons, would get it, Eskom chairman Ben Ngubane said. This leaves South Africans still in the dark about what caused the operational and financial collapse that resulted in Eskom being unable to pay its employees and suppliers. Eskom said yesterday it had paid Dentons R20-million for the probe, which Ngubane admitted was incomplete. It denied having interfered with the investigation, but admitted it canned the probe after Dentons had presented it with an interim report riddled with claims of corruption and fraud against some executives, board members and suppliers. Eskom said it would not release the report to the public as those allegations had not been tested. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
