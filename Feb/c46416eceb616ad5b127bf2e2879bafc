The DA has postponed its Eastern Cape elective congress which was scheduled for two weeks time. The congress, to be held in East London, will now be held on May 5 and 6. DA federal council chairman James Selfe said they were acceding to a request from the party&#8217;s provincial executive committee. We want as many branches as possible to participate in the congress, and extra time will allow this to happen, he said.
