Eastern Cape Premier Phumulo Masualle addresses business and civic leaders in Port Elizabeth Premier Phumulo Masualle will table his state of the province (Sopa) address tomorrow which will be centred on radical economic transformation. ANC provincial secretary Oscar Mabuyane said yesterday a Sopa was expected that would be crystal clear on the economy and all other issues. The theme is radical economic transformation and the ANC expects to hear the decisions of the recent provincial lekgotla coming alive in the premier s address. Mabuyane said the province s position at the bottom of the matric pass rate remained an embarrassment, but the ANC was confident that stability following the appointment of education department head Themba Kojana would improve things. The premier is expected to outline the department s turnaround strategy. On the education front, DA Bhisho legislature leader Bobby Stevenson said he wanted to know what would be done differently this year to ensure that young people left school with the skills needed to find jobs.
