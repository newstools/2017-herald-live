TRANSPORT TROUBLE: Students mill around at NMMU s Missionvale Campus yesterday after taxi drivers angry over the university s shuttle service blockaded the entrances Picture: EUGENE COETZEE Lectures came to a halt at NMMU s Missionvale Campus yesterday after taxi drivers from the Northern Areas Taxi Operators Association (Natoa) blocked all the gates, saying a transport company was poaching their route. The association members have accused Blunden Coach Tours, which transports students from Summerstrand to and from the campus, of taking their business away. Students walked around the campus idly while lecturers stood next to their cars. Police were also monitoring the situation. Lectures can t happen today because it is not safe for us to leave our cars out in the street, a member of a group of lecturers, who declined to be named, said. We have been standing out here for about two hours. NMMU management later met the association and it was agreed to open up the entrances while discussions on the issue will continue at a follow-up meeting. A taxi driver, who declined to be named, said: This is our route and we cannot allow Blunden to transport students to and from Summerstrand.
