Julian Brown is allegedly the head of a multimillion-rand poaching enterprise Picture: Supplied NPA abandons bid to have cash forfeited much to friends relief Suspected perlemoen kingpin Julian Brown will hold onto his R800 000 bail money after all, bringing relief to the friends and business acquaintances he claimed loaned him the cash. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) confirmed yesterday that it had abandoned an application to have the cash forfeited to the state, following its initial claims that the money was the proceeds of unlawful activities. NPA provincial spokesman Tsepo Ndwalaza said his office could not gainsay the evidence provided in Brown s opposing papers. Brown, 31, accused of heading a multimillion-rand perlemoen syndicate, was taken to task in the Port Elizabeth High Court in November last year, with the Asset Forfeiture Unit (AFU) demanding to know how he managed to come up with the huge amount of money in less than 48 hours. The AFU said Brown could not have generated the money legitimately through his construction company, J&amp;B Construction. Surprisingly, Brown, who now lives in Jeffreys Bay, agreed. In his opposing papers, he said only R5 000 of the total amount came from his own pocket. Brown, represented by Danie Gouws Attorneys, said the remainder was loaned to him by friends and business acquaintances, ranging from the father of a former girlfriend, to a truck driver and an electrician.
