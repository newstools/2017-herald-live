Mbete&#8217;s spokesperson Amanda Madikiza also could not confirm the swearing-in of Molefe. &#8220;I would not know. I don&#8217;t have that kind of information &#8221; said Madikiza. Molefe has also resigned from the board of the Industrial Development Corporation. He has been tipped to take over from Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan or his deputy Mcebisi Jonas.
