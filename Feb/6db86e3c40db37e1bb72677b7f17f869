A Night out partying ended badly for an off-duty Port Elizabeth policeman after he opened fire on a man who allegedly robbed him of his cellphone in Central yesterday. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said the police constable, who she declined to name, was walking in Parliament Street when he was accosted by a man at 6am. He was allegedly robbed of his cellphone, Naidu said. She said the policeman left but returned to the Central street a few minutes later. That is when he spotted the suspect who had robbed him of his cellphone. A confrontation took place between the police officer and the alleged suspect. Shots were fired but Naidu said the alleged thief escaped unharmed. He ran up Parliament Street but one of the bullets hit a vehicle. Luckily, the owner had just gotten out of the car. She said police were called to the scene and the policeman was arrested for malicious damage to property, attempted murder and discharging a firearm while under the influence. The policeman, who is also a member of the Flying Squad, is being detained at the Humewood police station. Central resident Ntomboxolo Makwethu, 32, said she had just arrived home when she heard gunshots. Anything is possible in Parliament Street because of the clubs in the area, she said. I peeped through my bedroom window and saw a man running up the street. I did not see where the shots came from. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
