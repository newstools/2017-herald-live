The Nelson Mandela Metropolitan University (NMMU) is investigating a possible policy violation after a staff member was accused of sending a racial email condemning Muslim prayer sites. In an email circulating on social media the staff member accuses Muslims of pushing their religion on the western world and expect us to tolerate and accept this but it s about time that we westerners stand up and say enough is enough . The email goes on to say: If they want their so called centre then they must have it in their own country . The University has distanced itself from the contents of the email. The University categorically states that the views expressed in the email are not those of the institution and go against the very core of its values which include the respect for diversity. NMMU was made aware of this matter via a formal complaint on Friday morning and immediate action was taken to launch an internal investigation into the possible violation of the University policies and values the outcome of which will determine the appropriate sanction the university said. The University does not tolerate or support religious discrimination and intolerance of any kind. The institution strongly embraces and supports the rights of all people including those of Islamic faith to practice their beliefs and religious practices including prayer. The university said it has strict policies guiding how emails sent from the NMMU domain should be handled. The University is not taking this matter lightly and is working to speedily conclude its investigation. &#8211; TMG Digital Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
