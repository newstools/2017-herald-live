Shakes Mashaba Picture: GALLO IMAGES While Shakes Mashaba has a right to be reinstated he cannot dictate how the SA Football Association runs its affairs Safa s lawyer has argued. Anton Myburgh SC told the Labour Court yesterday that the former Bafana Bafana coach s application was not urgent and the court should not interfere with Safa s contractual obligations. Mashaba has approached the court to stop Safa from hiring his replacement before his dismissal challenge at the Commission for Conciliation Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) is finalised. He was fired as national team coach in December after a disciplinary committee found him guilty of gross misconduct insubordination and violating the communications policy of Safa. This followed a public outburst in November in Polokwane, when Mashaba had a go at Safa bosses and the media. He has a right to be reinstated but he has no right to tell us how to conduct our affairs Myburgh said. He said there would be no grave injustice against Mashaba if Safa hired another coach while the CCMA matter was pending. Judgment will be given on Tuesday next week.
