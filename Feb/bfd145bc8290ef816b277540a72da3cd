GIVE US A CHANCE: Unemployed graduates protest as part of the #HireAGraduate campaign Picture: EUGENE COETZEE Years spent in internet cafes applying for jobs, taking on piecemeal work and sitting at home culminated in a silent protest by unemployed graduates along Govan Mbeki Avenue yesterday. pending hours applying for jobs has become the norm for Shelly Sigaba, 42, as she tries to make ends meet for her two children. For this reason Sigaba, of Uitenhage, decided to join about 15 other Port Elizabeth graduates who took to the streets as part of the #HireAGraduate campaign. The campaign gained momentum on social media last week when hundreds of graduates demonstrated in East London and Alice. Sigaba, who holds a diploma in public management from Walter Sisulu University, said the campaign aimed to highlight the plight of unemployed graduates and hopefully draw the attention of potential employers in both the public and private sector. When I went to university I truly believed that I would see the end of poverty in my home in Whittlesea, Queenstown and even send my siblings to school, Sigaba said. Instead they could not go beyond matric as I have not been able to secure a job in my field of study.
