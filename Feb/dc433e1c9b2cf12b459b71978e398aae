The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality is looking at everything from underground water sources to seawater desalination to weather the seemingly unending drought, mayoral committee member Annette Lovemore said last night. Addressing about 100 residents at a Wildlife and Environment Society of SA (Wessa) information session hosted in the City Hall auditorium, Lovemore began her presentation titled Water: The Challenge in an upbeat mood, praising the national Treasury for allocating the much-needed funds for the completion of the Nooitgedacht low-level water scheme. She said, however, that despite the site handover taking place on February 10, construction had yet to start due to SMMEs demanding their piece of the pie. Amatola Water, which would oversee the construction, would have a meeting with the SMMEs tomorrow to resolve the impasse. Lovemore said the municipality expected the overall capacity of the metro s five supply dams to drop below the 50% mark by next week. On March 7, a media conference would be held to inform residents of the potential implementation of stricter conditions.
