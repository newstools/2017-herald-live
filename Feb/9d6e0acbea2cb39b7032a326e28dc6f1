It is no secret that Trevor Noah and his bae Jordyn Taylor are completely smitten but try to keep their romance away from the spotlight. So when they do treat fans to special moments between them everyone is left green with envy. Trevor and his girl Jordyn rocked the red carpet at the recent NAACP Awards. And it goes without saying that they totally killed it. Had a beautiful weekend celebrating the 48th Annual NAACP Image Awards. Thank you for having us and for acknowledging the genius beside me!
