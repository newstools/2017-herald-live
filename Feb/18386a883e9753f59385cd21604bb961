Trip to Sea World part of revamp research A trip to Sea World in Florida will help decide the way forward for Port Elizabeth s Bayworld. The trip, to take place in April, comes as an extensive public participation process to discuss the revamp of Bayworld reaches its final stages. The proposed visit will see Mandela Bay Development Agency (MBDA) planning and development manager Dorelle Sapere, along with a delegate from NMMU, jet off to Sea World as part of their research. The agency is investigating the viability of Bayworld with or without live animals. The revival plan came under scrutiny and received sharp criticism from animal rights groups last year when the MBDA revealed that bringing animals back to the facility was among a range of ideas that were part of Bayworld s revival plan. The facility last housed dolphins seven years ago, before much-loved Domino and Dumisa were moved to Ocean Park in Hong Kong. MBDA spokesman Luvuyo Bangazi said the trip to Florida would assist the agency to make an informed decision on their stance on sea mammals in captivity. We have met various stakeholders with keen interest in the facility and these include proand anti-animals-in-captivity groups, Bangazi said. The MBDA had not yet taken a position on the matter.
