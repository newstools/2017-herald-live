TERTIUS DORFLING Picture: Supplied A string of text messages, e-mails and private Facebook chats between a former Linkside High School pupil and her science teacher, now accused of statutory rape, was presented to the Port Elizabeth Regional Court yesterday as the state attempted to bolster its case. The woman, now 20, claims she had sex with Tertius Dorfling, 54, in September 2011, when she was just 15 years old. She accused him of grooming her and said they had constant telephonic communication. The alleged sexual relationship lasted for about six months. Dorfling, who was subsequently fired by the Department of Education, on Monday pleaded not guilty to a count of rape, and sexual penetration of a child. Referring to certain messages yesterday, which have also been seen by The Herald, the woman explained that baby , love or angel were pet names Dorfling had for her. The police s Cyber Crime Unit extracted the messages from Dorfling and the complainant s phones after the allegations came to light in 2014. Earlier, the woman broke down on the witness stand where she testified for the second consecutive day as she was forced to repeat the details of the alleged affair. If I have to repeat it again, I am going to leave, she told defence attorney Alwyn Griebenow. Griebenow had accused her of being a problem child and manipulating the accused. You want to get back at him for not finishing your matric, he said. The woman explained that her parents had removed her from the school in Grade 12 after the allegations emerged. Griebenow said Dorfling had lent his jacket now an exhibit before court to the complainant one day at school because she was cold. He said Dorfling would deny he had sexual intercourse with the complainant. The trial was postponed to July 12. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
