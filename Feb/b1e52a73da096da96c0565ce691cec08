After starting her own label Nomuzi Mabena Music in August last year, followed by the release of her 2016 hit single Recipe, Moozlie has come into 2017 swinging. The 20-something entertainment sensation, who has also been working on her EP, has dropped her latest single Ride or Die this weekend. It features the talented Yung Swiss. My fans had to wait a long time for #ROD and I&#8217;m so happy that it&#8217;s finally out. Swiss and I had a really great time making this record and I just hope the love we put into it shines through. She says Ride or Die is a completely different sound to what she s produced in the past and, just like herself, shows she is continuously going against the grain and forging her own path of authenticity. Ride or Die was produced by Playground Productions, with Sbudaroc e xecutive producer. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
