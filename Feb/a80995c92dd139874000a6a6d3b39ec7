Chippa United defender Justice Chabalala says the team will be going for the kill when they host Golden Arrows in a Premier Soccer League fixture at Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane tomorrow (kickoff 8pm). Chabalala made his way to Port Elizabeth at the start of the second half of the season on a six-month loan from Orlando Pirates. The former Free State Stars player said a win was vital after their 2-0 loss against Bloemfontein Celtic at the weekend. The Chilli Boys are eighth on the log with 20 points from 17 games. We are ready for this game and we will be going all out for the kill, Chabalala said. We lost against Celtic and we also got a red card, so now our plan is to do well in our next game. We are hungry for a win. The players have been working very hard at training this week. The coach just said to us: Now we are playing Arrows, it s a big game and we need a big win . The Giyani-born player made his debut for Chippa against Mamelodi Sundowns in a match that ended in a 1-1 draw. In the two games that he has featured in since his arrival at the club, Chabalala has fitted in nicely and has been influential in making sure that the Chilli Boys defence is firm. He said the crowd at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium (against Sundowns) was encouraging. Looking at the support base one can see that Chippa is not a small team, Chabalala said.
