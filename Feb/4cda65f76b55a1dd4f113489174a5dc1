DEDICATION RECOGNISED: Lulamile Robert Skepu has received an award for selfless service. Picture: Judy de Vega When ill health forced him to retire from teaching, Lulamile Robert Skepu got a job working in the laundry at Livingstone Hospital. Soon he started cleaning the hospital and grounds after hours and he even started a garden at the entrance with his own money. Skepu says he seeks only God s approval. Nonetheless, hospital chief executive Thulane Madonsela has recognised his selfless dedication to the hospital with a special award for excellence. Skepu, 59, who was born and bred in Alexandria, said: From the time that I was small my grandmother said it was not good for me to lie around the house and play marbles. Go work in the gardens of the white people, she told me. They will teach you to garden and then you can learn their language too , he laughed. After Skepu obtained his matric, he qualified as a teacher at the Lovedale College of Education, going back to Alexandria to teach and then moving to Walmer. He started working at the Livingstone linen bank in 2006 and then moved to the laundry. I liked it because you could just leave your work behind in the afternoon. It was not like teaching. It was more relaxing.
