A border police anti-smuggling team in Nelson Mandela Bay has discovered and seized nearly 2 000 litres of alcohol valued at an estimated R2.5-million during a raid on a shipping container at the Port of Ngqura. Police spokesman Constable Mncedi Mbombo said the raid, which took place at about 9am on Thursday, had been initiated after a tip-off about the illegal alcohol shipment. According to Mbombo, the container was destined for Saudi Arabia where it is illegal to produce, import or consume alcohol but he could not confirm whether that country was the final destination for the liquor, or a transshipment point. Police found 480 20-litre drums in the container. Ninety-seven of the drums were full of liquor. The estimated value of the liquor that was confiscated is about R2.5-million, he said. Police were yesterday unable to reveal the origin of the container, the exact nature or type of alcohol, whether it had been bottled, or under which pretense the liquids were being shipped. The alcohol is still being verified, said Mbombo, who also did not respond to questions around possible communications or inquiries between South Africa and Saudi authorities over the smuggling attempt. He said police were investigating the illegal sale of liquor without a permit , as well as fraud. At this stage no arrests have been made, he said. In 2010, police seized millions of rands worth of cocaine which had been hidden in a container at the same port. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
