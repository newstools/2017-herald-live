AIMING HIGH: NMMU cheerleaders perform their winning routine during the Varsity Sports cricket final Picture: KELLEY FELIX With a mix of gymnastics, acrobatics and modern dance, NMMU cheerleaders came out tops at the third annual national cheerleading championships at the weekend. It was the third consecutive win for the NMMU cheerleaders, who used a combination of dance moves, stunts and pyramids to bag the sought-after trophy. The 24-member squad, made up of 14 women and 10 men, dazzled the audience at the Varsity Sports Cricket final at North-West University in Potchefstroom with gravity defying moves such as American style flying and throwing of up to 10m. NMMU cheerleader manager, Nicki Ann Rayepen, said the team had been practising the winning routine for up to six hours daily since the start of last month. We pride ourselves on working really hard. There is such an amazing team spirit, Rayepen said. Squad captain Greshen Ahrens, a fourth-year education student, said the squad aimed to perfect the moves set out by the South African Majorette and Cheerleading Association (SAMCA), which judged the event. With everything we do, we always question Will this be enough to defend our title? All the university teams are great, Ahrens said. Ahrens is assisted by vice-captain Courtney Mattheus, a third-year pharmacy student and dance teacher. Six teams from around the country battled it out including the University of the Western Cape (UWC), which came second, and hosts North-West University, which placed third. Cheerleading started as a sport at NMMU in 2014, with the launch of the cheerleading society last year. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
