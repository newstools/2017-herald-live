Paul O Sullivan File picture: Puxley Makgatho / Business Day The lawyer for Paul O&#8217;Sullivan says he is going to challenge the arrest of the private investigator on Monday as it is in contravention of a court order. Willie Spies said he would be going to the High Court in Pretoria on an urgent basis on Monday evening to have O&#8217;Sullivan released immediately. &#8220;He has been arrested in front of my offices this afternoon after a consultation &#8221; Spies said. He said there were &#8220;seven different police cars&#8221; involved in the arrest. Spies believes that police &#8220;interjected communication&#8221; between himself and O&#8217;Sullivan. &#8220;This is in contravention of a High Court order from November 2016. I showed this order to Brigadier Ncube (the arresting offcer) and he was of the view that it related to another matter &#8221; Spies said. He added that the acting police commissioner Khomotso Phahlane had agreed that O&#8217;Sullivan would be given 48 hours notice if he was due to be arrested. The order allowed for the investigator to hand himself over to a police station Spies said an agreement that police had not stuck to. Spies said O&#8217;Sullivan has been charged with impersonating an Independent Police Investigative Directorate officer and a similar charge has been leveled against one of O&#8217;Sullivan&#8217;s associates attorney Sarah Trent. Trent was arrested on Friday and released at the weekend. O&#8217;Sullivan has been assisting the directorate in investigating Phahlane for corruption. Meanwhile police refused to confirm the arrest. &#8220;I&#8217;m not in a position to call or confirm. Our policy is not to identify an arrested person until they have appeared in court; if there is any change I will advise you &#8221; said police spokesman Brigadier Sally de Beer.
