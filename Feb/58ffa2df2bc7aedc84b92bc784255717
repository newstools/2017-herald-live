NEW PHONE: Journalists check Huawei s latest phone, the P10, following its presentation at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona Picture: AFP The smartphone revolution is poised to go onto the next level with superphones equipped with artificial intelligence now on the horizon. By learning their owners habits, these new phones will be able to carry out tasks even when they are offline. During a first phase only high-end smartphones will use the technology, like the new models unveiled by China s Huawei at the Mobile World Congress, the phone industry s largest annual trade fair, which opened yesterday in Barcelona. But the technology is quickly gaining ground. More than 300 million smartphones or roughly a fifth of units sold worldwide will have the function this year, according to Deloitte. Huawei France marketing director Vincent Vantilcke said: It is one of the key areas we are investing in. After the smartphone, we will have the superphone thanks to artificial intelligence, . South Korea s LG and Finland s Nokia both announced in Barcelona that they would use Google s voice assistant, which uses artificial intelligence to answer users questions, in their newest handsets. Every big company in the sector is investing all their research and development on this, Gartner analyst Annette Zimmermann said. California-based start-up Neura has developed a system of artificial intelligence that can decode a smartphone user s daily patterns of behaviour. Neura says its technology can be used to enable smarter healthcare, cars, music services and homes by constantly updating their portraits of user behaviour patterns.
