A dark man, wearing lime green sunglasses at the time, is being sought in connection with a rape late last year. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said the suspect allegedly emerged from the bushes at about 7am on November 26 last year and approached a 24-year-old woman standing at the corner of Hanna Avenue and Van der Stel Street in Rowallan Park. The suspect walked up to the victim, threatened her and escorted her back into the bushes. He demanded money, her bank cards as well at the ATM PIN, Naidu said. The suspect then took the woman further into the thicket where he pulled out a knife and allegedly raped her. After the rape, he tied her to a tree and went to withdraw cash from the ATM. The woman managed to free herself and reported the incident. Naidu described the suspect as an African male, dark of complexion and slender in build. She said he was between the ages of 25 and 30 years, and was wearing lime green sunglasses at the time. Anyone with information is asked to contact Detective Sergeant Joshua Shilajoe of the Family Violence Child Protection and Sexual Offences Unit on 071 475 2310 or 041 401 3000.
