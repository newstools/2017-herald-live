Pierre Voges. Picture: BRIAN WITBOOI DETAILS of a confidential deal and a millionrand secret payout have emerged almost three weeks after former Mandela Bay Development Agency (MBDA) chief executive Pierre Voges parted ways with the prized entity. Leaders of the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality and MBDA are tightlipped about the behind the- scenes negotiations which took place late last year before Voges announced his resignation. Since walking away from the MBDA last month after 13 years at the helm, Voges has landed a top job as a consultant for the agency. He has been hired on a shortterm contract by the MBDA to manage the city s R2-billion Nelson Mandela Stadium. While three metro insiders said the new job came with a R160 000- a-month price tag, the MBDA said it was considerably lower but re &#8211; fused to divulge the amount. MBDA board chairman Phil Goduka said Voges was in charge of finalising agreements with the stadium s anchor tenants as well as drawing up a commercialisation plan for the stadium until a permanent manager was hired. The job was advertised by the MBDA last month and the board hopes to fill the position by April. News of Voges s new job comes hot on the heels of a golden handshake believed to be more than a million rand that he is said to have secured from the MBDA before his departure. While Goduka refused to say why Voges was given a payout, insiders said it was to avoid a protracted lawsuit.
