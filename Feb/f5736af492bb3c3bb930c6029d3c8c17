Several Despatch residents ran amok yesterday morning, blocking Old Uitenhage Road with burning tyres. The Mahashe residents started protesting at 3am, wanting to know why the houses they were promised last year had not yet been built. A protester, who declined to be named, said: Some of the houses [that are built] are incomplete and others have cracks. We were approved for houses last year but we are still staying in shacks that leak on rainy days. He said a contractor had started building houses in September, but had suddenly stopped. We want decent houses that were promised to us, the protester said. Ward 41 councillor Simphiwe Tyukana condemned the protesters for burning tyres instead of approaching his office. We can t ruin what we already have, he said. I have a satellite office in Despatch and people can make use of it to report grievances. Housing Development Agency (HDA) official Thembekile Fono arrived before lunch to address the protesters. The agency builds houses on behalf of the Department of Human Settlements. Fono told the protesters there had been a problem with paying the contractors. This has since been resolved. The contractors will start working on Monday, he said.
