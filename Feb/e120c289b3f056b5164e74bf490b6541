Learning that he has a superstar as a fan has blown away comedian Trevor Noah. This especially coming after winning two awards in the US at the weekend. South Africa s funnyman now working as a top TV host in the US took to his social media platforms to say: What a night &#8230; what a life . The moment he is treasuring is getting to meet music guru and record producer Quincy Jones. I ll Be Good to You is a song produced by Jones and he sure lived up to it when he met Noah. Here s how it went in Noah s own words: Oh what a night. You meet the most Grammy Awarded Artist Alive Mr Quincy Jones and he tells you he s a fan of your comedy. I laughed and said he s being polite he replied I m too old to bullshit . #grammyweekend #Legend #OhWhatALife. Oh what a night.
