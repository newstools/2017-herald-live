President Jacob Zuma said he was not bothered by the spate of insults spat angrily at him across the National Assembly floor before the Economic Freedom Fighters were ejected from parliament. He described the EFF under the leadership of Julius Malema as an angry minority in the country. Zuma ripped into his critics after the chaotic state of the nation event during a breakfast briefing in Cape Town yesterday. He chose his words carefully but there was little doubt that they were meant for Malema. Asked whether the Sona debacle in which he was called a constitutional delinquent was symbolic of a divided nation he laughed. We are dealing with people who have quarrels with their colleagues, he said. If, for example, you are dealing with an organisation that was established by young people who were expelled from the ANC they must be angry with the ANC. They must be trying their level best to fight back, but they don t know how. These people he said frustrated debate yet called themselves democrats. Democracy is not about angry young people. Democracy is about debating things. He said the fracas caused in parliament does not bother me . It was no different he said from fighting against a lunatic apartheid government.
