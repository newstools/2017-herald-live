Trevor Noah Picture: Trevor Noah/ Facebook Comedian Trevor Noah is heading back to Mzansi for a two-night comedy show later this year. Trevor will perform at Johannesburg s Ticketpro Dome on August 10 and 11. The show will feature all-new material and focus on how his life has changed since taking over as host of The Daily Show in the US. I am coming back home to do a show not because Donald Trump has kicked me out but because I would like to do a show for you, Noah said. He was supposed to return to South Africa to host the MTV Africa Music Awards late last year but cancelled at the 11th hour after falling ill. Tickets for Trevor Noah Live at the Dome go on sale via Ticketpro on Monday, priced from R300. TshisaLive Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
