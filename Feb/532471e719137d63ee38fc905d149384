The Oscars were trending for all the wrong reasons on Monday morning when the prestigious movie awards announced the wrong winner in its Best Picture category. Musical La La Land was originally announced as the winner of the award. Except it was Moonlight that had actually won. The mix-up was only discovered after the producers of La La Land had come on stage to accept the award. The mistake caused a stir in the audience and a tsunami of reaction on social media.
