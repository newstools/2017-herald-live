During Angelina Jolie&#8217;s interview with the BBC about her new film she also gave a glimpse of how difficult the split from Brad Pitt has been. &#8220;My focus is my children our children and my focus is finding this way through. And as I said we are and forever will be a family &#8221; said an emotional Jolie who also shared that it has been a &#8221;very difficult time&#8221;. Her new film &#8216;First They Killed My Father&#8217; is based on genocide in Cambodia. Rewind to almost 11 years ago: Jolie gave birth for the first time on African soil. The couple welcomed their daughter Shiloh Nouvel in Namibia. At the time the Sunday Times quoted from a statement issued by Brangelina: &#8220;While we celebrate the joy of the birth of our daughter we recognise that two million babies born every year in the developing world die on the first day of their lives. These children can be saved but only if governments around the world make it a priority&#8221;. They also gave their first television interview in Nambia. They thanked the country for the &#8221;peaceful birth&#8221; and Jolie said they were in love with Nambia which was the perfect place to spend time with their adopted children. Last year the perfect Hollywood pair split and divorce proceedings started. Questions about the custody of their six children have been raised in the media ever since. During the BBC interview at the weekend Jolie was asked what she would want like to do when she wakes up in the morning. &#8220;Hmmm get through the day. It has been a difficult few months &#8221; she said. &#8211; TMG Digital/TimesLIVE Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
