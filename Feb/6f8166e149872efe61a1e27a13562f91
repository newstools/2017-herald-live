The Director of Public Prosecutions has provisionally withdrawn charges of perjury and defeating the ends of justice against the girlfriend of the man who allegedly helped arrange Jayde Panayiotou&#8217;s murder pending the outcome of that trial. Babalwa Breakfast changed her statement to police to deny knowing about a hit on Panayiotou, allegedly at the behest of her husband, Christopher. The suspected middleman, Luthando Siyoni, was at the Port Elizabeth Magistrate&#8217;s Court on Friday to support Breakfast as she made a brief appearance. The murder trial proceeds in the Port Elizabeth High Court on April 19. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
