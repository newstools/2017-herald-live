Lionel Cronje of the Southern Kings kicks for goal during the Super Rugby match between Southern Kings and Jaguares at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium Picture: Michael Sheehan/Gallo Images The Southern Kings got their 2017 Super Rugby campaign off to a disappointing start losing 39-26 to the Jaguares at Nelson Mandela Bay stadium on Saturday evening. There were some bright early moments for the home team as they quickly ran up a 9-3 lead after nine minutes before the visitors chipped away to claim the lead at the break. Playing in front of a mere 2 226 spectators, flyhalf Lionel Cronje kicked four penalties while the Argentines scored a beautiful, well-worked try through scrumhalf Gonzalo Bertranou, four penalties and conversion to see the Kings trailing 19-12 at halftime. A further two penalties soon after restart saw the Jaguares move into a comfortable 25-12 lead. And when No8 Leonardo Senatore and fullback Lucas Noguera got in for the team s second and third tries respectively before the hour-mark, the game had been taken away from the Kings. There was a consolation moment for the Kings when right wing Makazole Mapimpi stepped wonderfully through the opposition to score his team s first try of the campaign 13 minutes from fulltime. And there was more joy on the final hooter when Luzuko Vulindlu rounded off the night with a try. The Kings now travel to play the Sunwolves at the Singapore National Stadium next Saturday. Point-scorers: Southern Kings: Tries Makazole Mapimpi, Luzuko Vulindlu; Conversions: Lionel Cronje (2); Penalties: Lionel Cronje (4) Jaguares: Tries: Gonzalo Bertranou, Leonardo Senatore, Lucas Noguera; Conversions: Joaquin Diaz Bonilla, Santiago Gonzalez Iglesias (2); Penalties: Joaquin Diaz Bonilla (3), Santiago Gonzalez Iglesias (3).
