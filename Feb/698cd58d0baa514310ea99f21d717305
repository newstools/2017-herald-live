MASTERMIND: NMMU student Byron Batteson won R10 000 in a coding competition Picture: BRIAN WITBOOI It took software coding mastermind Byron Batteson a little less than 10 minutes to win R10 000 when he won the SMSPortal s Crack the Code competition. Batteson, 21, a fourth-year NMMU computer sciences student, was among fewer than 300 entrants who completed the competition in record time and had the best possible solution. Due to the high demand for software developers worldwide, SMSPortal held the three-week competition to identify young talent. Batteson said that while he entered the competition last year, he did not expect to win it. This is probably the most entertaining online coding competition I have come across. I love that it s not just a programming competition but tests all sorts of problem-solving skills which, fortunately, aligns with what I enjoy. I had nothing planned for that morning so I decided to try it out and see how it goes. I did not find it difficult because I had previously done a module on coding, but I definitely did not expect to win the whole thing. he said. The contest is in two phases. Entrants are presented with a formula they must solve. Once it is cracked, the result is a five-digit short code that they must SMS with their names. They then receive an online link to a coding test. SMSPortal marketing manager Ryan Louw said the competition was open for a 24-hour period to allow those with full-time jobs to take part. Louw said SMSPortal s directors, James Pearce and Charles Stretch, were NMMU alumni, so an NMMU student winning the competition meant a great deal to them.
