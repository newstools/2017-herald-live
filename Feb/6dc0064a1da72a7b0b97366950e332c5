Nkosi Zwelivelile and Nkosikazi Nosekeni Rabia Mandela, photographed in Swellendam, with the Langeberg Mountains behind them Picture: Benny Gool Mandla Mandela and his wife of one year, Nosekeni Rabia Mandela, are expecting a baby. The couple announced this yesterday with a picture of a heavily pregnant Nosekeni with Mandela. The picture was taken in Swellendam, with the Langeberg range in the background. Mandela, chief of Mvezo village, married Nosekeni, then known as Rabia Clarke, in a quiet ceremony in Cape Town last year. Although their marriage was a closely guarded secret, the family said they wanted to share their latest happiness with the public of the Eastern Cape. We are exited beyond words today to be celebrating not only our first wedding anniversary but also the fact that we are expecting our first bundle of joy, Mandela said. Mvezo Komkhulu will once again experience the pitter-patter of a young Mandela s feet. We are truly blessed and grateful for the good wishes received. On Sunday, Mandela posted a picture of a home pregnancy test kit on his Instagram page with the message Alhamdulillah , Arabic for Praise God . Nosekeni is a Muslim. Last year, Nelson Mandela s grandson said he was honoured and delighted to announce his marriage to Nosekeni and was happy to be welcomed by the Muslim community, her parents and their extended family. Our coming together reflects what we have in common: we are South Africans, he said at the time. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
