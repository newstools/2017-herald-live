POO PROTEST: Angry Ward 18 residents protest outside their councillor s Vuku Road office, claming that she does not listen to their pleas Picture: FREDLIN ADRIAAN A councillor&#8217;s assistant had to run for cover when angry Kwazakhele residents arrived at the Ward 18 council office carrying buckets of raw sewage. The group emptied the faeces inside the councillor s Vuku Road office yesterday morning and called for it to be closed. The office was reopened only on Friday after being closed for two weeks. It eventually opened its doors with the help of Umkhonto weSizwe veterans. Ward councillor s assistant Sakhi Nombakuhle was lucky to escape unharmed yesterday. I was doing my work when a group of people arrived and started throwing rubbish bags and the bucket of sewage. I then left the office, locked the gates and called the police, Nombakuhle said. The residents main gripe was that there had been no development in the area over the past two decades. One protester, who declined to be named, said: We are not happy about allocation of projects and that there are no food parcels.
