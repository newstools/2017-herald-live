The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality has been raked over the coals by the national Treasury for its indigent policy which has left the city s finances in a shambles. Amendments to the Assistance to the Poor (ATTP) policy, approved by the previous administration in June, have resulted in the metro having to shoulder a budget deficit of about R500-million for the current financial year. This is in stark contrast to the R4-million surplus it had forecast at the beginning of the 2016-17 financial year. The ATTP indigent policy provides free basic services and discounted electricity purchases to poor households. It was amended by the city last year to benefit all residents whose homes cost R100 000 or less. In a scathing letter, Treasury director of local government budget analysis Templeton Phogole warned that if the policy was not reviewed, it could lead to unaffordable tariff increases in the next financial year, which starts on July 1. The metro is seriously advised that the current indigent policy is not affordable and may result in higher than affordable tariff increases in the 2017-18 [financial year], he said.
