A Westering father who pleaded guilty to possessing and distributing child pornography will be sentenced in the Port Elizabeth regional court on Friday. Jayde Bailey, 34, appeared briefly in court on Thursday. The matter was postponed to Friday when the court will also consider a correctional supervision report in mitigation and aggravation of sentence. Bailey is also expected to testify. Bailey s female friend, aged 22, also made a brief appearance and was warned to be back in court on Friday. The woman who faces similar charges cannot be named until she pleads. She will stand trial separately. The two were arrested in March 2015 after police uncovered two hard drives containing 560 sexually explicit images and 401 videos containing child pornography at Bailey s home.
