KEY FIGURE: UDM president Bantu Holomisa meets party supporters in Kwazakhele on Saturday. Picture: EUGENE COETZEE UDM leader Bantu Holomisa reaffirmed his party s commitment to the coalition government in charge of the Nelson Mandela Bay metro council. Addressing hundreds of UDM supporters in Kwazakhele, Holomisa said tensions between mayor Athol Trollip and his deputy, Mongameli Bobani, had been blown out of proportion by the ANC, which had yet to come to terms with its loss. That is why they [the ANC] were quick [to talk about] a premature motion of no confidence, he said. Holomisa also had harsh words for councillors who spoke to the media. I don t want to hear through the media when there are problems with the coalition. There are UDM structures, provincial and national, that should deal with these matters. e reiterated the importance of dialogue when there were differences in a coalition. Deal very cautiously with your differences, try to resolve matters locally, but if you can t handle them bring them to us before we read about them in the media. Holomisa said residents would start to see change when the council tabled its own budget. We must ensure that Trollip won t seek to reward his constituency at the expense of the poor.
