Idols SA auditions return to Port Elizabeth this weekend after a two year hiatus. Producers of the song contest on television, announced an extension of auditions yesterday to three more cities Port Elizabeth, Polokwane and Bloemfontein. The tryouts will take place at the Boardwalk Casino on Saturday from 7am to 1pm. But only the first 200 musicians will be auditioned. M-Net publicity manager Ryan van Heerden said the audition was a race to the head of the line. Only those who are hungry for this opportunity will fight for their chance under the spotlight, he said. Mzansi Magic reality head Sphumelele Sibeko said the show tried to reach out to as many people as possible, but due to budget constraints it was not always possible. Logistics do not always allow us to reach everyone, but based on the public s pleas, we ve decided to go to the additional provinces this year, emphasising that Idols SA is a search to find the country s best, Sibeko said. The auditions are free and open to all South African citizens between the ages of 16 and 30. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
