They include: Johan Bloom at Galerie Noko Johan Bloom at Galerie Noko Johan Bloom at Galerie Noko Galerie Noko Galerie Noko in Russell Road is hosting the colourful solo exhibition by Johan Bloom, Reflective Identities, which explores the human condition in vivid acrylics which are suggestive of the &#8220;dreamtime&#8221;. His recent body of work takes a look at our place in the universe, time and space. An exploration of our common ancestry. Finding similarities in indigenous art, early human visual expressions and our digitised world as a bridge between past and present . From this he creates images that are simultaneously tribal yet modern, with figures and imprints on canvas and steel sculptures resembling early rock art. These are accompanied by modern and ancient symbols as diverse as barcodes, @signs, pixilation and biometric fingerprints. Reflective Identities is open until March and gallery hours are 10am to 6pm on weekdays and 10am to 4pm on Saturdays. Inquiries: Usen Obot, 073-088-5883 or Nelisa, (041) 582-2090.
