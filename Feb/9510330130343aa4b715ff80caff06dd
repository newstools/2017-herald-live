Cajun-spiced calamari with basil and lime mayonnaise Cajun-spiced calamari with basil and lime mayonnaise Ingredients 4 T olive oil for frying cup plain flour cup cornflour (maizena) 1 t ground cumin 1 t dried or ground coriander 1 t curry powder t dried chilli flakes t salt pepper for seasoning 500g calamari, cut into cm rings Basil and lime mayonnaise 6 fresh basil leaves juice of lime 1 egg yolk cup olive oil pinch of salt and pepper Method Prepare the dressing first. Blend all ingredients for the basil and lime mayonnaise together in a tall jar using a stick blender and adjust to taste. (Tip: if you would like to have a thick consistency to the mayonnaise, then add the oil only after the other ingredients, and dribble it in slowly so that it emulsifies. Otherwise it will have a much thinner consistency.) Next prepare the calamari. Rinse and pat dry the calamari rings with a kitchen towel or a clean dish cloth. Place the calamari rings in a large mixing bowl. Pour over the flour and spice mixture and toss gently to coat. Add the oil to a wok or large saucepan over a high heat. When the oil is hot, drop in one calamri ring, it should be golden and crispy in 1-2 minutes. Add individual rings, one at a time, and fry until golden. Remove using a slotted spoon and set aside to drain on two layers of kitchen paper on a plate. Serve immediately on a platter with the basil and lime mayonnaise as a dipping sauce.
