Emergency services parked where the savage attack took place in Rowan Street in Rowallan Park. Picture: Supplied The three pit bulls involved in a savage attack on a man in Rowallan Park at the weekend have been euthanised at their owner s request. Animal Welfare confirmed yesterday that the dogs had been put down. Their owner, Marcus van Meiring, is under investigation for failing to prevent injury to another person under the Animal Protection Act. The victim, whose identity is still not known, is still fighting for his life in Livingstone Hospital. He was attacked in Rowan Street on Saturday afternoon and on Sunday had his arm amputated. After the attack, residents claimed on social media that the victim had tried to break into the house. But no one has provided any evidence of this. Two of the dogs were removed by Animal Anti-Cruelty and later handed to Animal Welfare. Yesterday, Van Meiring handed the third dog to Animal Welfare.
