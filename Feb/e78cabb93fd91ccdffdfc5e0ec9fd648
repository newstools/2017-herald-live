Khanyi Mbau Picture: Veli Nhlapho Khanyi Mbau will take her acting career to new heights with a starring role in an upcoming thriller set for release later this year. Mbau, who starred in last year s hit romantic comedy Happiness Is a Four-Letter Word is set to play the lead role in the thriller The Red Room. To be released in August, it also stars Pakamisa Zwedala and Aubrey Poo. According to the film s producers, Mbau plays the role of a rich woman named Zama who is kicked out onto the street and into the dark world of human trafficking. Mbau, who has already started shooting scenes for the film, said the role had challenged her to step out of her comfort zone. My role and the film are very different from anything I have done before. It shows my dark side and is a more meatier role. I found it challenging at first but I am an actor and this is what I signed up for, she said. Mbau said she first heard about the project last year and auditioned for the role because the film dealt with themes that fascinated her. It really delves into the psyche of a woman and the extremes she will go to to protect their family she said. It was fascinating, she said, to play a role that showed how human beings could push their limits. I am always looking for a new way to express myself to lose myself in a role and I found that with this film.
