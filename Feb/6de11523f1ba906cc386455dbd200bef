NSFAS and Higher Education Minister Blade Nzimande have been saying missing middle class parents must earn less than R600 000 per year to get funding. My son s application was declined because I earn more than R120 000. I m a widow with two children at NMMU and I don t even earn half of R600 000. My daughter has not received a response yet to her application. I ve been calling the NSFAS with no luck for a week. Where does the R120 000 limit come from? Can anyone please help?
