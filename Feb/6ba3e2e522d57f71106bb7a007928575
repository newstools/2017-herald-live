Family man admits his obsession led him to go younger and younger A Port Elizabeth family man who possessed and distributed child pornography, said he had been addicted to porn like anyone else . Before I knew it, I was going younger and younger, Jayde Sheldon Bailey told the Port Elizabeth Regional Court. But while Bailey, 35, tried to mitigate for a non-custodial sentence yesterday with offers to assist the police to infiltrate the child porn web, the state was determined to see him imprisoned for his crimes. You are aroused by children. People are repulsed by it, said state advocate Jason Thysse, describing his actions as sickening. Bailey and his 23-year-old female friend were arrested in March 2015 after police uncovered two hard drives containing 560 sexually explicit images and 401 videos containing child pornography at Bailey s Westering family home. He pleaded guilty in September last year to the possession and distribution thereof. I knew it was wrong, I tried to seek help but everyone was so negative so I became scared to speak about it, Bailey said. In the beginning [child porn] was available on almost every web page. I came across people with the same interests and then we started trading [videos and images]. In some of the clips, newborns and toddlers, some still in nappies, were being raped, tortured and murdered.
