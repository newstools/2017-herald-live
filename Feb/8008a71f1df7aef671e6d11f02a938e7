Eastern Cape Social Development MEC Nancy Sihlwayi File picture: Brian Witbooi MEC admits debt for Bay facilities where contract costs doubled in two years After months of obfuscation about the debt her department ran up at the only two fully state-funded frail care centres in Port Elizabeth, Social Development MEC Nancy Sihlwayi finally admitted this week that her department owed East Cape Frail Care R26-million. Sihlwayi said a request to the provincial Treasury to bail them out had been turned down. A forensic probe would be conducted to find out how the contract for frail care had more than doubled in price from R26-million to R54-million a year, over a two year period. Sihlwayi was replying to questions by the DA s Bobby Stevenson in the provincial legislature earlier this week. Port Elizabeth s only two specialist frail care centres Algoa Frail Care and Lorraine Frail Care were earmarked for closure when the contract for East Cape Frail Care was not renewed last year. The plan was to move patients at the end of December. However, the Port Elizabeth High Court ordered the department to extend the contract until a plan for their relocation had been approved by a curator or judge. Stevenson said yesterday that the debt was not declared to the Eastern Cape legislature when the adjustment budget was discussed in November. The stench of maladministration hangs over this botched contract, he said. The tragedy of this is that it has caused disruption, heartache and fear to the 239 families involved.
