EFF leader Julius Malema is due back in court in June Picture: Graham Stonell A third court case against EFF leader Julius Malema in relation to comments he made about land has been postponed to June. Malema appeared briefly in the Newcastle Magistrate s Court on Friday. The firebrand leader was charged with incitement to commit crime. He would appear in the same court again on June 5. This was in relation to a call he made for people to occupy vacant land after appearing in the same court in November last year. Last year Malema faced two charges of contravening the 1956 Riotous Assemblies Act. He appeared in the Newcastle and Bloemfontein Magistrate s Courts. Both matters were postponed because his lawyers are approaching the high court to have the Riotous Assemblies Act declared unconstitutional.
