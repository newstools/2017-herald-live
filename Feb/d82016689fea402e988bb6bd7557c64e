The JSE opened firmer on Friday after President Jacob Zuma s delayed state of the nation address after the EFF were removed from the chamber and the DA walked out. Investors appeared to be relieved that Zuma did not refer to an imminent Cabinet reshuffle. An expected announcement by President Donald Trump on widespread tax reforms has also lifted global markets. Trump described his tax reform plan as &#8220;phenomenal&#8221; which lifted sentiment on Wall Street. The Dow closed 0.59% higher at a record 20 172.40 points. His plan is set to be unveiled within the next few weeks. Asian markets were sharply higher with the Nikkei 225 gaining 2.49% and the Hang Seng up 0.45% on positive marcoeconmic data from China. Novare economic strategist Tumisho Grater said Zuma emphasised the role of black empowerment as a key part of all economic programmes. &#8220;However none of the programmes mentioned were new and as we are aware reform implementation has been slow &#8221; she said. On a whole Zuma s address was in line with expectations. &#8220;The next big event on the calendar is the budget speech &#8221; she said. Analysts said the budget would give the ratings agencies the opportunity to judge the government s efforts in adhering to fiscal discipline in the low-growth environment. The local market followed a stronger rand the currency firmed to R13.35 to the dollar from a previous close of R13.38. It remained range-bound between R13.38 and R13.42 during Zuma s speech weakening only briefly to R13.46. Trump s envisaged tax plan is good news for financials and banks.
