SAND SAVE: Caylum Boon executes a bunker shot during yesterday s action at the SA Amateur Championship at Humewood Golf Course Picture: GREG DE DONCKER The first all-South African final since 2014 will also be an all-Southern Cape affair in the Sanlam SA Amateur Championship after Caylum Boon and Christo Lamprecht showcased their skills in a four-club south-westerly wind that pummelled the players in first the quarterfinals and then the semifinals at Humewood Golf Club yesterday. Boon downed Andre van Heerden, from Mpumalanga, 3 and 2 in their semifinal and Lamprecht sealed a 1-up victory against Dylan Kok, from Gauteng North, in their knockout match. But it was in the quarterfinals that the South Africans really stepped up to the plate to guarantee that the title of the premier amateur event stays on local soil. Boon denied Scotland a third successive, and fifth victory in seven years, when he ousted last man standing Liam Johnston at the 21st hole in the quarterfinals. After beating Yashas Chandra, from the Indian Golf Union s Gentlemen Squad, 4 and 3 to make the final four, Lamprecht faced Kok for a spot in the final. The Louis Oosthuizen Junior Academy player opened with six straight pars and was 3-up at the turn after a birdie at seven and a double bogey from Kok at six. I m excited to play the final. Last year, I made it into the match play, but I got knocked out in the first round. I only wanted to do better this year, so this is a huge surprise. It s nice to up against Caylum in the final, though. There is no pressure; it will be like a home game, Lamprecht said.
