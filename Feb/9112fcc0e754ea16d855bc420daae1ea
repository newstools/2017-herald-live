Vogue Paris is to become the first French magazine to feature a transgender model on its cover, according the honour to Valentina Sampaio, of Brazil, for its March edition. The French edition of Vogue describes the 22-year-old as a femme fatale who happened to have been born a boy. Beyond her evident physical qualities and her sparkling personality, [Sampaio] embodies . . . a long and painful fight against being perceived as a gender exile , the magazine s editor-in-chief, Emmanuelle Alt, writes in her editor s letter. The day it will no longer be necessary to write an editorial on the subject, we will know the fight has been won. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
