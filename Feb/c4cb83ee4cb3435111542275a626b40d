Animal Welfare manager Hannes Stander, strokes the animal Picture: GARETH WILSON A woman who tried to dump her dog on the side of the busy William Moffett Expressway at the weekend has landed in trouble, with police investigating the incident. The woman, on being confronted, reportedly put the dog back in her car, only to drop it off again later on. Yesterday police confirmed that investigations into animal abandonment and abuse were under way. The Animal Welfare Society (AWS), now housing the dog, will assist with the investigation. Witness Michael Hutchinson saw the woman dragging a dog into the bush next to the road. When he confronted her she said she would take it to the AWS, but motorist Angela Soliman later found the animal wandering in the road.
