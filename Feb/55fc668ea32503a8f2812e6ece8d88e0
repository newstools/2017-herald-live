The SPCA has laid a complaint with the police against a man who rode his horse into the Jeffreys Bay SUPERSPAR in Da Gama Road on Sunday. The SPCA described Rick Erasmus s ride as attention-seeking. Erasmus recently made headlines after the SPCA took him to task over the poor state of rescued horses at his horse ranch, Featherfoot Farm. SPCA inspector Benjamin Sithole said the organisation did not want to compromise its case by giving too much information at this stage. This is someone who is seeking attention. I can confirm we have an animal cruelty case opened against him, Sithole said. There is a pending case already against the man. It turned out, according to Erasmus, that the supermarket was their third stop, with the horse and rider already having spent some time at a nearby pub and then at a liquor store. Erasmus said he was not aware of a case being opened against him related to Sunday s events. I will state my matter when it goes to court. My lawyer is busy handling a separate case the SPCA brought against me, he said. Police spokesman Sergeant Majola Nkohli was also unable to provide details of the case. Erasmus s antics garnered mixed reaction on social media, with many accusing him of animal cruelty. Others felt the shopping trip was nothing more than a little lighthearted fun. Eleanore Wilkie said: [The] horse is petrified . . . can see white of eyes. No shoes on [the] horse and by the sound of it just being ridden into the ground around JBay. No water. Just a drunken, arrogant, cruel beast on his weary thin back. Michelle McLean Peyper disagreed. I was there horse and rider were fine. Brought a lot of smiles to workers in SPAR, she wrote.
