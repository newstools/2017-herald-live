Only 10 of 23 ANC branches in Nelson Mandela Bay have passed an audit to affirm that their branch general meetings were properly constituted. This will delay the regional conference at which a new leadership is to be elected even further as the branch meetings that did not pass the audit would have to be held again. A regional task team has been in charge of the party s affairs in the metro since December 2014. Several attempts to hold a regional conference over the years have fallen flat due to infighting within the party. ANC Eastern Cape secretary Oscar Mabuyane said the ANC was eyeing the first weekend in March as a possible date to hold the conference. The date has been shifted countless times since 2015. The region is struggling to get the required 70% [of branches that have passed the audit] but we are pushing for a congress early next month, Mabuyane said.
