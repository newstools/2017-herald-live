President Jacob Zuma has criticised opposition MPs for traumatising the nation and treating parliament like a beer hall after they interrupted his state of the nation address last week. Responding to the debate on the address yesterday Zuma promptly referred to last week s pandemonium and appealed to MPs to use democratic mechanisms chaos. Some MPs have decided to treat this house like something worse than a beer hall, he said. The conduct we saw here traumatised millions . . . including a 12-year-old [praise singer] he said amid heckling by some opposition MPs. DA MPs shouted like you treat the constitution after Zuma s beer hall reference. Last week the president was subjected to a barrage of insults and attacks by opposition parties particularly the EFF who delayed his state of the nation speech for more than an hour labelling him illegitimate and a thief who had broken his oath of office. After raising numerous points of order EFF MPs were eventually forcibly removed by parliament s protection services. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
