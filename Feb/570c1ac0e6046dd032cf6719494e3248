Police are looking for information about a murder that took place in Port Elizabeth last month in which a car and a cellphone were also stolen. Police turned to the public yesterday after hitting nothing but dead ends over the past month. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said Kobus Jonker, 51, had found dead inside his Newton Park flat on January 9. Jonker was found with multiple stab wounds. Naidu said the body had been found by a neighbour, who had become suspicious after returning from work that afternoon. The neighbour said that when he left for work in the morning Jonker s front door and garage had been open and when he returned in the afternoon they were still open. Being concerned, he went to investigate and found [Jonker] dead inside the flat. Naidu said Jonker had lived alone but, according to other residents, he had had people in his flat the day before his body was found. His cellphone and his white Chevy Spark with the number plate DNH060EC were still missing. Naidu said anyone with information should contact Constable Robin Meyers, on (041) 394-6247.
