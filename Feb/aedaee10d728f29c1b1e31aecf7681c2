Almost three years after an off-duty policeman was gunned down in Motherwell while assisting a furniture removal truck, the men allegedly responsible for his murder will stand trial in the Port Elizabeth High Court. Charles Nqaba, 24, of Motherwell, and Jabulani Mkaba, 26, of Zwide, face charges of murder, attempted murder and the unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition. In a detailed indictment before court where the men will stand trial from today the prosecution details how Constable Devin Hattingh, 31, was shot at close range while seated in the driver s seat of his silver Volkswagen Polo in July 2014. Police officers Sergeant Sisanda Qokosa and Constable Vuyani Libi, who were patrolling in the area at the time, observed the shooting and were also shot at while they tried to apprehend the perpetrators. Hattingh, from the Mount Road police station, had escorted a truck to Nyara Street in Motherwell to deliver furniture at noon on July 28 2014. It is understood Hattingh provided private security services in his spare time. After the shooting, Mkaba fled on foot, while Nqaba sped off in a white Ford Fiesta. Qokosa and Libi gave chase and eventually arrested Nqaba in Mgwalene Street, close to where the shooting took place. Mkaba was nabbed a short while later. Both men appeared briefly in the high court yesterday, where the matter was postponed to today for the prosecution to present its case.
