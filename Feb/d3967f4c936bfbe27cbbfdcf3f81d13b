LOSING BATTLE: The demolition of the Sardinia Bay Lifesaving Club s clubhouse is under way Picture: FREDLIN ADRIAAN Lifesavers undecided on next move Despite months of protests and letters of complaint, the demolition of the Sardinia Bay Lifesaving Club clubhouse which was established more than 40 years ago has started. This follows a decision by authorities to tear it down in line with legislation to protect the coast. The question now is whether its members will continue the fight to preserve the club, or dissolve it. Club secretary Sue Hoffmann said it was a sad day for them when the levelling work began on Friday. We have been members of the club for the past 14 years. The municipality just ignored us. They are giving us the middle finger, she said. Hoffmann said the windows, ski-racks and wooden decking were dumped in the parking lot, despite their request to keep it. Someone just took it, she said. We haven t received any compensation. The least they [municipality] could have done is give us a call. One of the club s founding members, Grant Breetzke, said it was a terrible day for him. I actually can t believe they went ahead with it 44 years of lifesaving history has just gone out the window, he said. Sardinia Bay s lifesavers have always been of the highest degree. We didn t only protect beach-goers, but also the bay and all those who used it. We even helped horse riders. We must now decide whether to dissolve the club or continue to fight. The worst for me was the municipality s attitude.
