South Africa s President Jacob Zuma (right) and Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa Picture: Mike Hutchings/Reuters Jacob Zuma and Cyril Ramaphosa &#8216;can t stand each other&#8217; a newspaper reported on Friday. The Mail &amp; Guardian quoted an unnamed senior government official as saying there is a cold war between the president and deputy president and that in public they will pretend as if all is well but that s not the case . The report said Ramaphosa has objected to being sent on numerous overseas assignments as this has been interpreted as distracting him from campaigning to assume leadership of the ruling party at the end of the year. Zuma is said to prefer his ex-wife Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma taking over from him and has been angered by comments Ramaphosa has made about problems in the ANC s current leadership. Ramaphosa has also been vocal in his support for Finance Minister Pravin Gordhan who is said to stand in the way of Zuma s efforts to gain more control over the Treasury.
