Melissa Allison chose her songs well Picture: Eugene Coetzee With Idols SA season 13 auditions taking place tomorrow, The Herald saw fit to round up a few familiar faces who have gone through the audition rounds to give a few tips to those hoping to make it in the singing competition. The search for South Africa s favourite singer continues tomorrow at the Boardwalk Casino from 7am to 1pm. With only the first 200 contestants auditioning, hopefuls need all the help they can get to secure a golden ticket and make it through to Sun City. Season 8 contestant Melissa Allison was one of the first Port Elizabeth hopefuls to make it far into the competition. She said, for her, prayer was what got her through. I prayed and knew that if it s God s will I will make it through . . . If it s not, He has a plan for my life beyond that audition, so that calmed me down. Allison added that song choice was an important aspect of making it through. [This] showcases your vocal ability. You only have one chance at a first impression. Be careful not to choose songs that have too many lyrics, a monotonous melody or one that goes beyond your vocal ability because you have to allow for nerves. Choose the key of your song wisely, she said. Loyiso Gijana, who was Season 11 s youngest contestant, said even though some might doubt Idols SA s relevance and importance, being on the show catapulted one s musical career. The auditions are the hardest you need to bring the best rendition of yourself as the songs that you sing on the first audition should give the judges an idea of the kind of artist you want to be, Gijana said. I m so excited the competition is coming back to Port Elizabeth as people are realising there is a lot of talent here, he said. The auditions are free and open to all South African citizens between the ages of 16 and 30. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
