Households in Nelson Mandela Bay with a monthly income of more than R3 000, but whose homes are worth R100 000 and less, will be scrapped off the list of residents receiving free and discounted services. The city will, from next month, embark on a verification process to ascertain if those benefiting from the Assistance to the Poor policy qualify for the discounts. However, budget and treasury head Retief Odendaal said no beneficiary would have services terminated before the verification process. The municipality fears a financial crisis if the policy is not amended. The mayoral committee agreed yesterday to amend the policy. Currently residents whose homes are worth R100 000 or less automatically qualify for free services and discounted electricity. Mayor Athol Trollip said the policy as it stood was enough grounds for an immediate audit qualification. It states that all residential properties valued at R100 000 are automatically granted ATTP irrespective of the income of the household. If there are people that reside in that property mayor, doctor, teacher or a nurse they earn enough to pay for services, he said. You cannot unilaterally take a decision that there will be no qualification or verification irrespective of the household income. So anybody who wants to reflect this as not being pro-poor if people who can afford to pay do not pay, we will not able to provide services to the poor. Already we have to absorb a burden of R465-million because of this decision, he said. The city will hire an outside company to start verifying all 23 705 ATTP beneficiaries who were recently added onto the indigent list, at an estimated cost of R5-million. The policy change will be discussed at the next council meeting. Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
