In less than three minutes burglars managed to steal 18 bicycles and 30 pairs of sunglasses worth R1.2-million from a Bryanston Johannesburg cycle shop. Video footage shows a number of people smashing through a glass door at the Complete Cyclist store. They gained access to the premises by battering the shop&#8217;s front window with bolt cutters and then hurling a rock through the safety glass to break it. It is not clear how many people were involved said store manager James Barnes. The video has been circulating on social media showing just how fast the burglars were each carrying up to two bikes out of the store at a time. Barnes said the break-in on February 7 was the second within a month. The first took place on January 10 where merchandise worth R1.9-million was stolen putting the total value of goods stolen at R3.1-million. Barnes said Specialized Wilier Pivot and Silverback road and mountain bikes were stolen. He said six badly damaged bikes had been recovered from the latest burglary close to Sandton Clinic.
