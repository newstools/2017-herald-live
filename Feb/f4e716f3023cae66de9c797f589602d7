Comedian Casper De Vries will be performing an extra show in Port Elizabeth next week. The first show on Thursday is already sold out and tickets to the second show, to be staged next Friday on February 24, are now available at Computicket at R120 to R140 per person. Both shows will take place at the Boardwalk Amphitheatre at 8pm. Although De Vries announced his retirement from doing one-man stand-up comedy in an interview with Channel 24 in 2013, he has made a strong comeback since and will again be spouting a whole lot of hilarious controversy in his latest routine, titled Alive en Vrolik. More theatrical and intimate than before, is how De Vries has described this show. This time I ll be performing in my living room, he quipped, since he associated the comfort of being on stage with being in his living room. I walk up and down because I can and it feels like home. The unapologetic comedian, actor, entertainer, painter, composer, director and producer has attracted an international reputation for his absurdity on stage. Besides the two Port Elizabeth shows there will also be a show at Hemingways Casino in East London on Saturday February 25. Patrons should note that Alive en Vrolik is not for the faint-hearted or easily-offended and is not suited for those aged 16 years and under.
