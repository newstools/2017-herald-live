MAMELODI Sundowns have different more international priorities than anyone else but that does not mean they cannot still win the Absa Premiership coach Pitso Mosimane says. Even as Downs prepare to meet TP Mazembe in the Caf Super Cup at Loftus Versfeld tomorrow, further complicating their schedule Mosimane said he thought the Brazilians would defend their PSL title. Sundowns winners of last year s Caf Champions League (ACL) meet Democratic of Republic giants Mazembe, winners of the last year s Confederation Cup, tonight, with Downs having home advantage as winners of the more prestigious competition. Mosimane believes the match could be a springboard to Downs beginning the defence of their ACL title playing the first-round fixtures next month. He said Downs priority was again continental football. If you want to play in the Club World Cup the Super Cup you want to be team of the year in Africa it depends what do you want? You can be team of the year in South Africa. But you can be that and someone is winning the Champions League outside you can t be African team of the year then.
