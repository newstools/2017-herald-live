EFF leader Julius Malema has given a press conference following the party&#8217;s ejection from Parliament. Malema criticised Zuma for failing to uphold the constitution, saying that this meant that Zuma was occupying the presidency illegally. &#8220;South Africans who&#8217;re not happy with us will thank us later. You will thank us for protecting the constitution,&#8221; Malema said. &#8220;Without a constitution we are a mob,&#8221; Julius Malema said. The EFF will not be part of the debate on president Zuma&#8217;s State of the Nation address. The EFF are currently taking questions.
