Swartz has served as vice-chancellor for two consecutive terms since 2007. Under his leadership, NMMU launched more than 15 centres and institutes aimed at discovery, application and innovation in the natural and human sciences. NMMU scored a number of landmark achievements that took the university well beyond the challenges associated with the merger years during his terms of office, Over the past decade, NMMU has also spent great effort on getting the social issues right, notably issues of social transformation, NMMU council chair Judge Ronnie Pillay said. He said Swartz would not be seeking a renewal of his contract at the end of 2017. Swartz will instead pursue other professional and academic interests. Council was made aware of his decision at the start of his second term of office, in January 2013, said Pillay. Council wishes to salute the vice-chancellor s phenomenal strategic fundraising campaign that over the last decade raised well over R2-billion, he said. We wish to extend our sincere thanks and appreciation for his years of dedicated service and singular commitment to ensuring NMMU grows to significant heights. In the coming months, the university will embark on an extensive recruitment and selection drive to look for a suitable vicechancellor and principal for appointment with effect from January.
