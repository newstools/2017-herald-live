STUDY TIME: Excited Alfonso Arries Primary School pupils show their approval as desks and temporary classrooms promised by the Department of Education are off-loaded. Picture EUGENE COETZEE &nbsp; EMBATTLED Alfonso Arries Primary School has been given a lifeline, with 11 more teachers deployed to the school and an additional nine classrooms which have begun to be delivered. Four classrooms are already on site along with 600 desks which were delivered to the Chatty school during the course of this week. The school is also expecting 200 more desks to complete the required 800. The new classrooms and furniture follow a two-week closure of the school after angry parents halted teaching on January 20 by blockading the gates and demanding that the Department of Education address overcrowding. The school has a capacity of 1 200, but a recent head count revealed that 2 254 pupils had been admitted. The school reopened last week after the department agreed to some of the demands made by parents.
