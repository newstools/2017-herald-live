A man was beaten by pursuing residents just seconds after allegedly robbing a shop in Uitenhage yesterday. The robbery happened at a spaza shop in Moeggesukkel informal settlement at about 8.30am. Police spokeswoman Captain Gerda Swart said the man, 35, who has since been arrested and treated at hospital, was beaten after he fell while trying to flee. Four armed men entered the business pretending to be customers, she said. One of the four pulled out a firearm and demanded money and airtime from the owner, before fleeing. Residents, alerted by the shop owner s screams, gave chase. One of the suspects fell and threatened his pursuers with a knife. The residents allegedly overpowered and beat the suspect, Swart said.
