The DA is showing its true colours in Nelson Mandela Bay! The ANC and other councillors fought for a humane handling of the situation, but the DA was adamant and shacks, and all people s worldly possessions, were flattened in the early hours ( Bulldozed , February 24). For the past 22 years, the Nelson Mandela Bay metro was governed with compassion and caring. All that ended the day the DA coalition took power on August 3 last year. Ignoring the pleas of its allies, the EFF, and most other parties, it allowed bulldozers to flatten furniture, school books, cooking equipment and clothing. Once again the savage face of an uncaring master was revealed in the cradle of the revolution! It was a face that Port Elizabeth, Uitenhage and Despatch residents thought was erased forever, but the destruction, carried out at gunpoint, rolled relentlessly ahead, deaf to the distress of the people. DA mayor Trollip said, We are not going to provide alternative accommodation for people who invaded land. One must ask oneself two questions: if it is metro land, whose land is it? The people s? And if our constitution gives the people the right to a home and the land belongs to all who live in it, black and white , what exactly does that mean? The DA has become expert at using the courts continuously to enforce issues that disadvantage the people. Perhaps it is time compassion and reality become more important?
