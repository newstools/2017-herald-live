ABOUT R400 000 worth of drugs and R300 000 in cash were seized in two separate raids on suspected drug dens in Port Elizabeth. Both raids were the result of tip-offs from residents. A man, 35, was arrested in his flat in Annerley Terrace, Central, following a raid at 9.30pm on Wednesday. Police spokeswoman Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said officers found a large sum of money, 7.5kg of dagga as well as stolen laptops and cellphones. She said three bags of money were found hidden in a compartment inside an oven. Another hidden compartment was found under the sink where the laptops and cellphones were discovered. Seven bales of compressed hydroponic dagga, worth about R350 000, were found in the suspect s garage. Police confirmed that the money found in the oven totalled R300 000. Another raid on a suspected drug den in Silver Oak Street, Algoa Park, at about 11am on the same day led to about R45 000 worth of tik being confiscated. Janse van Rensburg said police were alerted to the drug den after a tip-off. A search warrant was obtained and the house was raided. At the time, the man was not there but his fiancee and a 10-month-old child were found locked inside the house, she said. Bolt cutters were used to gain entry through the security gate after the woman claimed not to have keys to the gate. During the search three bags of tik, weighing 1.5kg, were found hidden in a cupboard. The docket has since been taken over by the newly formed narcotics unit at the Hawks who are following up leads on the man.
