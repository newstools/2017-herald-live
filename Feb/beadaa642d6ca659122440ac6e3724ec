South African foodies have declared today, February 27, our National Milk Tart Day and to mark it, Johannesburg s caterer-to-the-stars, Vicky Crease has given a traditional South African recipe a decadent new twist. Crease makes her elegant version which she calls a &#8220;Stoutlicious Milk Tart&#8221; with Castle Milk Stout, poached pear slivers and a salted caramel shard Last year I created a Beeramisu dessert, using Castle Milk Stout in this traditional Italian dessert and it was a great success. So I had to really think out of the box to try and beat that, and it came to me that milk tart is such a South African favourite that it was possibly something I could put a new spin on, Crease said. Who can resist fresh cream, infused with Castle Milk Stout, to create a dessert which is cool for the summer months and also not too heavy as an after-dinner treat. The caramel shard adds a hint of sweet and salty into the mix &#8211; right on trend according to Crease. For those who would like to try it at home, here s the recipe, which serves four. Allow preparation time of 1 hour, 10 minutes.
