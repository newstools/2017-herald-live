Paul O Sullivan File picture: Puxley Makgatho / Business Day Private forensic investigator Paul O&#8217;Sullivan has been summonsed to appear in the Pretoria Magistrate&#8217;s Court today. It follows his foiled arrest by police earlier this week. O&#8217;Sullivan has been accused of impersonating of an Independent Police Investigative Directorate officer during a directorate investigation into national police commissioner Lieutenant-General Khomotso Phahlane. Phahlane is under investigation for corruption which is linked to him allegedly receiving financial kickbacks from chemical manufacturing companies awarded supply tenders to the police forensic science laboratories which he used to head. Phahlane approached the Pretoria High Court last week to have O&#8217;Sullivan ordered to stop providing assistance to the Directorate in their investigation of him. Yesterday Directorate head Robert McBride revealed to the Police Parliamentary Portfolio Committee how O&#8217;Sullivan&#8217;s arrest was an attempt to disrupt their investigation into Phahlane was an act of intimidation and contravened the Act which governed the Directorate. Earlier this week O&#8217;Sullivan&#8217;s release was ordered after the police were found to be in violation of an earlier court order which said that he had to be given 48-hours notice if he was to be arrested.- TMG Digital/TimesLIVE Related Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
