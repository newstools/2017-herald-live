The best and worst places to be a victim of crime requiring police assistance has been determined by Statistics South Africa. Here&#8217;s the answer in just 3 sentences: &#8220;Western Cape has the fastest response time of the police to emergency calls. It is the only province where a significant percentage of households reported that it takes less than 30 minutes for the police to respond to an emergency call. &#8220;In the Northern Cape Free State KwaZulu-Natal and Mpumalanga households generally indicated that it takes more than two hours for police to respond to an emergency call. &#8220;North West has the worst police response time to emergency calls where more than 50% of the households reported that it takes more than two hours or never arrive.&#8221; This information is contained within the Victims of Crime Survey for 2015/16. Stats SA assessed the percentage distribution of households perceptions of the average length of time it takes the police to respond to an emergency call by province. In Gauteng a quarter of residents (25%) said it took less than 30 minutes for the police to respond to an emergency call. Thirty percent said police came within an hour and 21% said police responded within two hours. There&#8217;s also a &#8220;never arrives&#8221; box which was ticked by 4.5% of Gauteng residents.
