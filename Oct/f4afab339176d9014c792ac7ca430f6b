 Social media is abuzz with pages set up to out errant fathers, but the “deadbeat dads” – as they have been ignominiously tagged – are not all taking it lying down.

The Izinja Ezingondliyo (Dogs who don’t pay maintenance) Facebook page was created earlier this week, drawing in hundreds of mothers across the country who are fed up with ex-partners who refuse to pay maintenance for their children, despite being capable of providing it.
Over 80 000 people are already following – and swapping stories.
But it has also spurred a counterclaim page, with fathers giving their side of the story as to why they don’t cough up.
And in all the naming and shaming, a clinical psychologist has warned that exposing people on such platforms is not the solution and they should rather find an alternative way of mediation.
Mark Eaton said when people put private matters on public platforms they should consider the impact their actions would have, making children feel unwanted and not good enough.
He said such negative exposure would give a child low selfesteem.
According to the page administrator – who wished to retain his anonymity – it was created as a support system for all single parents, not just women.


“It is a pity it is predominantly women on this page. From the posts we see a lot of anger from the mothers and we thought by giving them a chance to vent their frustrations at the missing parent, then at least they would be able to heal and acknowledge that they are not alone in their situations.”
A member in the group who did not want to be named said: “It is easy for men to run away from the responsibilities of being a father and now we are speaking out and we are hoping males out there will see this exposé and learn to take responsibility for their children.”
Although the Facebook page encourages single parents to be vocal, the downside is that it has also been misused to take revenge on former partners out of jealousy or because of a relationship simply gone wrong.
Now fathers, who feel they have been treated unfairly, have created a counter page – Amadoda Angondliyo Ayaziphendulela (Men who default hit back) – explaining why they do not pay maintenance.
Reasons included doubtful paternity and lack of proper communication.
One of the members of the Izinja Ezingondliyo group posted: “My child’s father does not send any maintenance – he is able to go out regularly with his new girlfriend, but never has any money to send for the child’s needs. Apart from that, we have an agreement that he will call the child every day.
“Weeks go by and he does not call and I am the one who is left to explain the silence – sometimes it is not about the money, it is about making time for his child.”
In response to the accusations against them, a member of Amadoda Angondliyo Ayaziphendulela said the reason he did not pay maintenance was that it was then used by the mother to go out socialising.
Social media law expert Emma Sadleir said this type of naming and shaming was a clear case for defamation of character.
“Two things will be looked at when dealing with this case.
“Firstly‚ if it is in the public interest or [secondly] if it is just naming and shaming‚ which is a defamation of character.”
