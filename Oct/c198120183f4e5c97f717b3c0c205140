 Schools in the rural Eastern Cape have been given solar lighting kits by the Qunu Youth Development Foundation and SA Airlink to enable school children with no electricity at home to study after darkPicture: Supplied
An Mthatha NGO, the Qunu Youth Development Foundation (QYDF), has partnered with SA Airlink to provide 2 500 solar-powered lights to 35 primary and secondary schools in rural areas of the Eastern Cape.

The project, initially an SA Airlink social investment initiative, is directed at improving the conditions under which rural children study and are educated.
QYDF Founder and chief executive Phikolomzi Habe said the distribution of the lights was part of the foundation’s efforts to improve the conditions under which rural pupils studied.
“The Qunu Youth Development Foundation aims to engage itself in community outreach programmes, especially ones which are youth- and education-related. Whether big or small, we believe young people should always take first preference,” he said.


“When Yanga Mgodla from SA Airlink contacted me and told me that they have a project of this sort and they want to partner with NGOs to ensure fair distribution, we did not hesitate to jump on board.”
He added they wanted to see engineers, pilots, scientists and doctors coming from rural areas.
“Many children still use candles to study. In the deep rural areas the internet is a foreign concept. So we’re trying to assist these young people in whatever way we can and make sure that those who deserve these kits the most, get them,” Habe said.
“Our hope is that our relationship expands with SA Airlink so as to try to get in the pipeline the idea of introducing the internet to rural areas that don’t have access to it. Maybe try to give out tablets to the schools so that the first time they use these devices is not at university.”
SA Airlink representative Yanga Mgodla said the company had established that the number of pilots and engineers who came from rural areas was extremely low and had identified the solar lights project as a means to address this.
“We decided to distribute to the schoolchildren because we know some of them come from rather difficult backgrounds at home. Without access to electricity at home, studying and doing various tasks becomes very difficult.”
Gobizizwe Senior Secondary School principal Thuletu Mbixane, who heads one of the 35 schools that have already received solar lighting kits in Mqanduli said: “Our school was founded in 2013 so it is fairly new.
There are learners here who do not have electricity in their homes and it’s very difficult for them as they have to use candles and paraffin lamps, which are dangerous.
“After the donations, we had a parents’ meeting and parents expressed their gratitude that their kids received these solar lighting kits.”
Education department spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said: “We appreciate the zeal by responsible and active citizens who have opted to roll up their sleeves and participate in education.”
