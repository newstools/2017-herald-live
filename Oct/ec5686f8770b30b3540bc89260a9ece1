Hard work, long hours and an unbridled commitment to their work saw The Herald and Weekend Post claim five awards at the 2017 Vodacom Regional Journalist of the Year awards last night.
The announcement was made at Port Elizabeth’s Protea Marine Hotel as the Tiso Blackstar publications scooped five awards across 12 categories – including print news, print feature and photography, as well as sport and young journalist specialist category awards.
A Herald and Weekend Post team comprising several reporters took the print news award for the breaking news coverage of the Knysna and Port Elizabeth fires earlier this year. Riaan Marais won the print feature award for his in-depth report in the Weekend Post on a series of failed government projects meant to be carried out on the Krugerspost Farm in Cookhouse.
Veteran photographer Eugene Coetzee won the photography award for his picture published in The Herald of an exhausted fireman down on his knees as the water pressure in their hoses started failing while fighting the fires in the Schoenmakerskop area in November.
In the specialist categories, Michael and Kathryn Kimberley walked away with the sport category award for their exposé in the Herald on Christopher Wishlade, the man meant to be the saviour of the beleaguered Eastern Province Kings rugby team. The young journalist award went to Deneesha Pillay, a multimedia reporter for the Herald and Weekend Post.
This award recognises the efforts of rising stars in newsrooms across the region. Entrants must have worked in journalism for three years or less and demonstrate great future potential as a journalist.
The Herald and Weekend Post editor Brett Horner said this was a proud moment for him, and the awards encapsulated his team’s passion and commitment to producing quality journalism.


“This is a great moment for the papers and I could not be prouder.
“I salute every one of our journalists, as well as those in the background, for working their magic in difficult times, pulling together for the greater cause.”
Judging panel convener Ryland Fisher said the Eastern Cape region submitted 141 entries, most of a very high standard.
He commended The Herald and Weekend Post team for their innovation and determination in the work submitted.
Bongani Fuzile, from The Herald’s sister publication Daily Dispatch, took home the award in the sustainability category for his report on the Eastern Cape drought disaster.
Regional winners in each category receive R5 000 in prize money, with the exeption of the young journalist of the year regional winner, who receives a certificate.
All go through to the national awards in Johannesburg on November 16.
