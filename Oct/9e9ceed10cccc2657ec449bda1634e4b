Amakhosi blast three goals past AmaZulu and Bucs overcome Arrows in Knockout Cup
Kaizer Chiefs finally delivered a performance of some conviction when they began their bid to end a long barren spell without silverware with a 3-0 win over AmaZulu in the first round of the Telkom Knockout at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Saturday night.

George Maluleka, Pule Ekstein and Siphiwe Tshabalala all scored as Chiefs returned to an attacking approach – after several games with an uncharacteristically defensive outlook – and reaped the rewards.
Chiefs led 1-0 at half time through Maluleka and killed the game off with two quick goals early in the second half.
Both Maluleke’s goal, in the 32nd minute, and Ekstein’s shot, in the 55th minute, took hefty deflections.
But Tshabalala thrashed home a left-footed shot from close range as he celebrated his surprise Bafana Bafana call-up.
Ekstein had a much-improved performance and could have headed home with a hat-trick, had he taken all his chances.
AmaZulu could have been 2-0 up inside the opening 25 minutes, but Rhulani Manzini and the veteran Mabhuti Khenyeza spurned good chances.
Chiefs scored when Maluleka belted from a swift attack, set up by Itumeleng Khune from the back, and propelled forward.
His shot hit AmaZulu captain Mbongeni Gumede on the shin and looped over the head of goalkeeper Boalefa Pule for the opener, just past the half-hour mark.


New Chiefs defender Siyabonga Ngezana got round the back of AmaZulu just before half time but while his positioning was spot on, his header was wide.
Ekstein fired home with a deflection off Mlengi Cele to make it 2-0 and Tsahabala’s goal three minutes later came from a Joseph Molongoane cross from the right. ý In-form Thabo Qalinge struck in the 35th-minute of an impressive first-half display by Orlando Pirates as they negotiated a prickly path past dangerous Golden Arrows to reach the Telkom Knockout quarterfinals.
Bucs were convincing enough not to have provoked any heart attacks among their many supporters at KwaMashu’s Princess Magogo Stadium on Saturday to earn a first win in five matches.
Coach Milutin Sredojevic’s influence continues to impress as the Buccaneers showed urgency, built on his “iron defence, creative midfield and sharp attack”.
Pirates striker Thamsanqa Gabuza was not present again.
Wayne Sandilands was also missing in goal, where Jackson Mabokgwane took the gloves.
But Sredojevic, apart from having Bucs more urgent, has shown an ability to put out lineups that will challenge for results.
The coach had Thabo Matlaba pulled back from midfield to right-back again, and Ntsikelelo Nyauza tucked back into central defence for Abbubaker Mobara.
Justin Shonga and Thembinkosi Lorch came to the front for Thabo Rakhale and Mpho Makola, who dropped back to Matlaba’s open midfield space.
Defensive midfielder Issa Sarr might not have the best touch, but can be immense closing spaces in front of his defence. Pirates’ goal was well-worked. New Zambian signing Justin Shonga has shown some quality touches, and a chip from him from midfield found Lorch and he flicked the ball into the path of Qalinge, who spooned a chip over Arrows goalkeeper Nkosingiphile Gumede.
