 SuperSport United celebrate winning the MTN8 trophy after beating Cape Town City on penalties in Durban, on SaturdayPicture: Samuel Shivambu/Backpagepix
Not using Patosi could have cost side cup, says coach
Benni McCarthy acknowledged that his inexperience might have cost his side, after not utilising one of his most experienced players, Ayanda Patosi, in the MTN 8 final loss to SuperSport United. United were eventually crowned as champions of the 10th edition of the cup after they won 4-2 on penalty shootouts at the Moses Mabhida Stadium in Durban on Saturday night.

The match ended 1-1 after 90 minutes of regulation time and 30 of extra time.
The former Bafana Bafana striker‚ who is in his first job as a professional coach‚ also gave credit to his counterpart and former Bafana teammate Eric Tinkler (47)‚ admitting that his experience had played a huge role in the outcome of this match.
It was then left to the heroics of SuperSport goalkeeper Ronwen Williams‚ who saved Lyle Lakay and Judas Moseamedi’s spot kicks‚ for Amatsatsantsa to win their second top eight trophy and a cool R8-million in prize money.
In the end McCarthy, who would have celebrated an early 40th birthday present with victory (his birthday is on November 12)‚ accepted that perhaps he should have brought on Patosi in the second half to help his team.
“There [on substitutes] I accept that maybe the inexperience kicked in, or maybe it was just the excitement of seeing that it was close to 90 minutes,” he said.
“I thought ‘let’s just close the midfield‚ close the back’‚ hoping to hold to the win. It would have been remarkable if I had won this cup in my first final.”
McCarthy said it was a game they should have won after leading 1-0 for 80 minutes through Sibusiso Masina’s 23rd-minute goal.
Although SuperSport dominated the first 20 minutes‚ it was McCarthy’s team which finished the first half stronger after taking the lead, with Teko Modise dictating terms in Cape Town City’s favour in the midfield.
Fearing defeat‚ Tinkler made a number of substitutes of his own‚ bringing Thabo Mnyamane‚ Dove Wome and Sifiso Myeni before the 78th minute.


One of them‚ Mnyamane‚ scored the priceless equaliser in the 80th minute before limping off with a suspected groin injury.
Mnyamane’s injury forced Tinkler’s team to finish the game one man down and on back foot after Thuso Phala‚ Clayton Daniels and Bradley Grobler suffered with cramps.
But it will be McCarthy’s decision of not starting the match with a younger Patosi (24) instead of Modise (34) in the playmaking role which will be questioned.
Not using Patosi at all allowed Tinkler’s side to come back into the match with Mnyamane’s equaliser.
McCarthy did bring on striker Obinna Nsofor and Judas Moseamedi, when he had opportunities to usher in Patosi, who carries both international and overseas experience.
“I think as a coach that’s one of the faults that you have to take. I thought with us being 1-0 up and being in total control of the game‚ we were cruising,” he said.
“Obviously, you anticipate what the opposition will do.
“They were pushing on players. So you tend to go for like for like instead of strengthening your midfield or tightening the screw at the back.
“Based on the subs they made‚ we tried to match them.
“Maybe I got carried away when I brought Putsche when I should have used Patosi, given the damage that Teko was doing.
“We needed a creative player, so I accept that maybe I didn’t make the right substitute.”
