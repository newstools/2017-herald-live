A French court handed down a three-year suspended jail term yesterday to the son of Equatorial Guinea’s leader after convicting him of using public money to fund a jet-set lifestyle in Paris.
The 48-year-old vice-president of the west African state, who was tried in absentia, was also given a suspended fine of ß30- million (R492-million) by judges for embezzlement, money laundering, corruption and abuse of trust.
The case, which was spearheaded by two anti-corruption NGOs, is the first of three involving families of African leaders accused of using ill-gotten gains to live it up in France.
“Every year billions of euros are embezzled to fund the profligate lifestyle of a few corrupt leaders abroad, particularly in France,” Transparency International, one of the two NGOs, said, adding that it aimed “to ensure that France is no longer a place to launder money”.
Teodorin Obiang’s lawyers slammed the ruling as an “activist decision” and said they were considering an appeal.
The families of late Gabonese leader Omar Bongo and the Republic of Congo’s President Denis Sassou Nguesso are also under investigation for embezzlement.
Obiang is the son of Equatorial Guinea’s president of 38 years, Teodoro Obiang Nguema.
He was accused of spending more than 1 000 times his official annual salary on a six-storey mansion in a posh part of the French capital, a fleet of fast cars and artworks, among other assets.


Prosecutors argued he could not have funded the purchases without raiding state coffers. They had called for him to be given a three-year jail term and a ß30- million fine.
The Paris court handed down the sentences but suspended them, meaning that Obiang would only face jail time or have to pay the money if he is found to have re-offended in France.
The court also ruled that his ß107- million (R1.75-billion) residence near the Champs-Elysees avenue be confiscated, along with other assets.
Obiang did not attend his three-week trial in June and July, dismissing it as a farce.
His lawyers accused France of meddling in the affairs of a sovereign state.
The court ruled that while Obiang could not be tried in France for his actions in his homeland, he could be prosecuted for laundering money for his personal use.
Obiang was agriculture and forestry minister before being promoted by his father to vicepresident in 2012, putting him in pole position to succeed him as leader when the post becomes vacant.
Many of his eye-popping French purchases were made through Somagui Forestal, a forestry company that prosecutors called an empty shell used solely to channel public money.
