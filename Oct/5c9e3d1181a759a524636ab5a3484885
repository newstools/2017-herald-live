Hundreds of special needs pupils from four Port Elizabeth schools received a much-needed boost this week at the annual Happydale Special School Art exhibition, which saw pupils display and sell their artworks.
“A lot of these pupils, being special needs, have low selfesteem.
“Seeing their work displayed and being bought does a lot to boost their confidence and self-worth,” Happydale arts teacher and event coordinator Jean Gysman said.
The week-long exhibition – now in its second year – continues to grow, with pupils from Cape Recife High School, Merryvale Special School, Quest School for Autism and Happydale Special School all contributing art.
The artworks can be viewed in the Happydale school hall.
Gysman said the exhibition was aimed at improving the self-esteem of the pupils and exhibiting the often understated talent they had.
“Art also assists in developing the pupils’ skills,” she said.
“Many of them won’t go on to find work in a corporate environment and need to rely on their hands to make a living.


“This type of expo opens their minds to the possibilities of their potential. We have found that while working on a piece of art, the pupils’ concentration, hand skills, comprehension are all aided – in addition to their confidence.”
Happydale Special School pupil Nicole Meiba, 17, said: “I love doing art. I feel so proud of myself when the work is done.
“I want to do art after school, as it will help me grow myself.”
Happydale principal Craig Hendricks said the artworks, such as beading, knitting, fabric painting and other artistic styles, were being sold to the public, with prices ranging from R50 to R150 a piece.
“The children have been working throughout the year on the works and we are very proud of the quality of work produced,” Hendricks said.
“An event such as this really goes a long way in allowing these pupils to overcome a stigma and achieve more than even they could have anticipated.”
Nelson Mandela University arts and culture faculty director Michael Barry, a guest speaker at the exhibition, said: “This type of exhibition goes a long way to building the confidence and identity of the pupils. The standard is impressive.”
Merryvale department head Antoinette Esterhuyse said art placed the pupils on a level playing field with their peers and gave them a sense of pride and achievement.
