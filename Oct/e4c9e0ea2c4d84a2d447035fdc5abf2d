 Four-time champion after Schumi record
It may have been ugly, but Lewis Hamilton’s success in claiming his fourth world championship on Sunday has moved him within range of becoming the most successful racing driver of all time.
His ninth-place finish at the Mexican Grand Prix was not the way in which he had hoped to seal his triumphant season, but his racing peers and most paddock observers believed that mattered little.

Not only did the 32-year-old Briton deserve this year’s championship, but he proved he is capable of scaling even greater heights.
His age, the consistency of his Mercedes team and the maturing of his extraordinary raw talent for speed have combined to give him a unique platform for more record-breaking achievements.
Mercedes resisted a spirited challenge from a revived Ferrari to dominate the season and reel off a fourth consecutive constructors’ world championship.
That level of performance coupled with Hamilton’s talents means Hamilton has good reason to believe he can go on to win not only a fifth title, to equal the record of Argentine Juan Manuel Fangio, but rise beyond it to match German Michael Schumacher’s seven championship wins.
“Michael is still the greatest when you look at the outright results, but if Lewis stays and if Mercedes stay as competitive, you could see him getting close to winning seven,” his former McLaren teammate Jenson Button said.


Schumacher’s records of seven titles and 91 career victories remain unchallenged, but Hamilton, on 62 wins, has already passed his pole positions record – with 72 poles.
And, since 2014, he has won 40 races with Mercedes, at an average of 10 a season – a good enough return to justify belief in his potential to deliver more titles.
“He has made big decisions, including leaving McLaren, which was a surprise to a lot of people, including me,” Jackie Stewart, the man he has surpassed as Britain’s most successful F1 driver, said.
“It was a big decision and the right one. He has learnt so much there and has learnt a lot, too, from Niki Lauda, including managing his emotions. I think the best is yet to come from Lewis.”
Austrian Lauda, a three-time champion who is the non-executive chairman of the Mercedes team, said: “Lewis has driven like a god this season. He has proved he is the best on the grid and deserves his success. He is possibly the best ever.”
Hamilton himself was quick to dismiss any idea that he was considering following his erstwhile teammate, 2016 champion Nico Rosberg, into a prompt retirement. “Four is a great number, but I want number five now!” he said during Mercedes’ post-race paddock celebrations.
And in keeping with his high-speed lifestyle, he took a private jet from Mexico to Miami for a nightclub party with friends and family.
