Two people were killed and four escaped unscathed in another suspected gang-related shooting in Port Elizabeth’s northern areas.
Sheldon Saterdag, 25, and Andre Bezuidenhout, 21, were killed in the shooting, while the other four people, who were in the same Windvogel shack, escaped.
According to police, the shooting happened at 11pm on Thursday in a shack in First Avenue, Windvogel.
Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said a lone gunman had approached the shack and fired several shots.
“Two of the victims [Saterdag and Bezuidenhout] were standing at the door when an unknown person started shooting at them.


“The lights of the shack were switched off during the shooting, prompting the gunman to run away,” Naidu said.
“Once the suspect had fled, the lights were switched on and both deceased were found in the doorway.”
Naidu said the victims and the other four people inside the shack were believed to be part of the Boemdalers gang.
The provincial gang investigation unit is investigating two cases of murder and four cases of attempted murder.
No arrests have yet been made.
