Matthew Breetzke, Jade de Klerk and Kenan Smith up for triangular series
Three Eastern Province cricketers are in the South Africa U19 squad to play England and Namibia in a five-match Youth One Day International Triangular series in Potchefstroom from next month.
The talented trio of Matthew Breetzke, Jade de Klerk and Kenan Smith were named yesterday in a 17-man squad and the series – from November 30 to December 10 – will be one of the last opportunities for selectors to have a look at possible picks ahead of the ICC U19 World Cup in New Zealand early next year.
Free State’s Raynard van Tonder will captain the young team for the second time and is looking forward to another opportunity to lead from the front.
Van Tonder and his young teammates hope to come out on top this time.
The youngsters fell two runs short of victory in the final of their five-match series against the West Indies in June, ultimately losing the series 3-2 to the defending champions.
“It was really hard to accept the series loss in Durban against the Windies, but there has been a lot of cricket since then and more growth, and not just by me, but by the team as well,” Van Tonder said.

“I’m looking forward to captaining the boys again. I enjoyed stepping into the leadership position and learnt a lot.
“I want to take all those lessons and put them to use in this upcoming triangular series. The guys are excited and I’m also really excited.
“England and Namibia are tough competitors and it’s exactly what we need building up to the World Cup.”
Coach Lawrence Mahatlane believes they have found the right balance, as well as the sweet spot between youth and experience, and is looking forward to seeing how this team goes about the lessons learnt from the West Indies tour.


“I’m really happy with the squad that has been put together by the selection panel,” Mahatlane said.
“I feel we have the right personnel for all the different scenarios and a group of really fired-up youngsters.
Kenan Smith
“The series will be another tough task for the guys and the way we apply ourselves and our skills will be the key.
“There’s obviously a lot to play for, considering that we leave for the U19 World Cup in the first week of January next year, but for me right now, it’s about winning this series and making sure that we’ve laid the right groundwork for the tests still to come before we head out.”
The coach is optimistic of his team’s chances in the triangular and is pleased with the hunger shown by individuals during camps held in the last few months.
“It bodes [well] for the team. I’ve seen how hungry they are when we get together for sessions and the positive direction they have taken in the intervening months.
“It makes me really excited to see what they will bring to the party against the strong England and Namibian sides,” Mahatlane said.
