Police move in during the mock robbery and hostage situation at Greenacres Shopping Centre
Shoppers panic in mock robbery
A mock robbery turned into mayhem yesterday morning, with shoppers at the Greenacres Shopping Centre ducking for cover as police fired blank rounds inside the building.
A frustrated shopper told of the fear they had all felt.
The shopper, who did not want to be named, said: “We did not know what was happening.
“It was extremely worrying and scary.
“The police treated this as their playground, firing shots while people were running around trying to escape.
“I ducked under the table in the food court and one of the other couples sitting next to me also fell to the ground.
“A girl who must have been a teenager was crying and screaming uncontrollably.”
The man said several customers inside one of the centre’s banks had been in shock and an elderly woman had lost her keys and other valuables in the mayhem.
“I am extremely angry,” he said.
“I usually carry my private firearm with me and, luckily, I had a meeting so did not feel the need to carry it with me.
The robbery and hostage exercise was aimed at testing police and security responses.

“If I had had it with me, I might be up for murder charges as I would have intervened.
“I would be the one up for murder if I shot three or four policemen posing as robbers.
“Anything could have happened. People could have had heart attacks or collapsed – it is just plain reckless.”
Police spokeswoman Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said the drill had been held by centre management and police had merely assisted.
“The drill was to mimic a robbery where gunmen stormed the centre food court and fired shots at security officials.
“This was when the blank rounds were fired,” she said.
“The men then ran towards Shoprite and into the Street Fever shop.
“A standoff and hostage negotiation ensued during which police stormed the shop and arrested all five robbers.”
Asked why shoppers had not been warned, Janse van Rensburg said the centre should answer that.
Greenacres Shopping Centre’s Kirsti Dolinschek failed to answer several questions and referred them back to Janse van Rensburg.
“It was an emergency evacuation simulation, run by the full Greenacres precinct – The Bridge, Shoprite and Greenacres Shopping Centre,” she said.
