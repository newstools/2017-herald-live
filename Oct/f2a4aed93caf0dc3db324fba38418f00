On Wednesday evening March 30 last year Norman Howley was driving a truck delivering our sister newspaper, the Daily Dispatch, from Port Elizabeth to East London.
As he reached Colchester, about 40km outside Port Elizabeth, a group of people had blocked the road.
They harassed him out of the vehicle and then torched it.
That incident was part of a wider, violent demonstration by residents who had brought that community to a standstill.
They were angry – at least the story goes – because the then mayor, Danny Jordaan, had failed to show up at a meeting to discuss their housing needs.
That night, cars were stoned, and police used rubber bullets and stun grenades to disperse the crowds.
Two weeks later, Jordaan hauled his officials to a packed community hall where he made them answer tough questions about why they had failed to secure land needed to build low-cost houses.
You see, the local government elections were four months away.
Jordaan was under pressure to win over public sentiments.
And so in that meeting the political theatre unfolded.
Housing official Thembakazi Hlela had barely finished her presentation when Jordaan publicly berated her.
He felt her department was dithering instead of sharing concrete plans to buy the land needed for housing.
“We couldn’t come here the last time because we didn’t have answers. I didn’t want to come here and talk nonsense,” Jordaan chastised her.
“I want clear answers. When are we going to get land here? I’m giving you 14 days and you are going to come back here and tell us.”
The crowd erupted in applause.
Jordaan had bagged his brownie points.
The people had renewed hope.
But were things really as they seemed?
This week ANC insider Crispian Olver launched his tell-all book, How to Steal a City, The Battle for Nelson Mandela Bay.
A medical doctor-turned-bureaucrat and businessman, Olver spent more than a year in the belly of the beast in the dying days of the ANC’s rule in Nelson Mandela Bay.
He had been brought in by then minister Pravin Gordhan to head up the national government’s clean-up campaign into the city’s rotten administration. Simply put, Olver was the hired fixer.
His book gives a fascinating inside account of how corruption had become part of the very institutional fabric of the metro.
The story, although not unquestionable, is based on a mountain of municipal paper trail, Olver’s daily experiences and recorded interviews he conducted while in the city.
It also reveals how Olver himself got sucked into the dirty world of politics and money, compromising his own integrity.
It’s jaw-dropping stuff.
Here’s what piqued my interest.


The book points to a sinister hand behind much of the community unrest that rocked the city at the time.
The investigation into the housing department uncovered, among other things, what was believed to be a sophisticated “rent-a-protest” operation by officials and businesspeople in the city.
According to Olver, here’s how it allegedly worked.
Dodgy officials in the housing department would use their grassroots networks to agitate a community protest.
The more violent and sustained the protest, the more pressure it applied on the municipality to buy available land in the area for housing development.
The land owner would name his price, usually obscenely inflated in collusion with Mr Dodgy Official.
Under public pressure, the municipality would buy the land at the ridiculous price.
Contractors, also in on the scam, would be given tenders to build houses. Some were paid for work not done.
Others did such a shoddy job that the houses fell apart months after they were built.
All the players involved walked away with a fortune and then set their sights on the next community.
Of course not every protest was a result of political manipulation, nor were community grievances illegitimate.
However, according to Olver, investigations showed a peculiar pattern between community flare-ups and subsequent questionable land deals.
He notes, for example, how their probe into land purchases in Walmer, Uitenhage and Seaview – where there had been violent protests – had found that most of the properties were owned by one businessman.
In one instance, the businessman had bought a piece of land at market value, only to sell it to the municipality less than two years later at seven times the buying price. Appalling! Similarly, the story of the metro’s failed bus system, told extensively by this newspaper over the years, is as staggering.
Yet, despite all of this, only one person has been jailed so far (that I am aware of).
Others are, rightfully so, before the courts or under some kind of legal scrutiny.
However, many more effectively got away with the loot.
On one hand, this is because politics shielded theft.
On the other, it is because those who mastered the art of stealing went to great lengths to cover their tracks, thus making it a painstakingly difficult process to hold them accountable.
Whether justice will be served ultimately depends on the commitment of those currently in power and the efficiency of the systems available to them.
Nonetheless, the story of Mandela Bay remains an important one.
It is a microcosm of our country’s journey.
It lays out in granular detail the corrupt pattern between government and business.
It is a sobering blueprint on how public institutions are weakened and eventually broken down.
It shows how, when allowed, the powerful betray the most vulnerable.
It exposes the vicious heart of toxic power.
Ultimately, what we do with it will shape the kind of nation our children will inherit.
