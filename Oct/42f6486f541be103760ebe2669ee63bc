Pair procured young girls and disabled women for sex
Two women have been found guilty of operating a human trafficking ring in Port Elizabeth which saw children and mentally challenged women held against their will and procured for sex.
Nombuyiselo Matini, 50, and Nolubabalo Mboya, 25, face life in prison after they were found guilty in the Uitenhage Regional Court on several counts including racketeering, the sexual exploitation of a child and the sexual exploitation of a mentally disabled person.
In a lengthy and emotional judgment yesterday, magistrate John Montgomery said what made matters worse was that Mboya, the younger of the two women, came from a similar background to the young girls she had helped traffic.
The court had heard the harrowing details of how one of the victims – a mentally disabled child – had to have her pregnancy terminated after she was finally rescued by the police.
Another girl died in December last year after her health deteriorated, presumably as a result of the ordeal.
Matini, of KwaNobuhle, and Mboya, of Khayalitsha, will remain in custody until sentence proceedings, which are due to start on December 7.


Several children were rescued in July 2012 during a raid on a house at Hlathini informal settlement near the Fairview Racecourse, where the girls had been held in dire conditions.
The house had been used as the central operating point for the sex acts.
Montgomery said the girls had been kept sedated and locked in a room for several months while being sexually exploited.
Gifts, money and sometimes even food were exchanged while the girls were forced to perform sex acts against their will.
“The victims were detained under threat, force, coercion and deception.”
Montgomery accepted the evidence of the complainants –which had been heard in-camera – and found the evidence against the two accused to be overwhelming.
They had pleaded not guilty to the charges.
Matini was found to have headed the brothel and made money by prostituting out the girls, who were procured by Mboya.
State advocate Zelda Swanepoel said that the brothel had been in operation for a staggering six years between April 2006 and July 2012.
