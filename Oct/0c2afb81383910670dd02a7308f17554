Coming from underprivileged communities, pupils from Nxanelwimfundo Primary School in Motherwell and Booysen Park Primary recently experienced the glamour and the high life in Cape Town.
Nxanelwimfundo Primary took part in the Western Cape Schools Drill and Marching Festival competition held in Cape Town, where they excelled, while Booysen Park Primary pupils had a dream visit to the cosmopolitan city thanks to a violin project started at the school by the Eastern Cape Philharmonic Orchestra and their sheer determination to raise funds for the trip.
Fifteen primary schools and 10 high schools went head-to-head in the march and drill showdown.
Nxanelwimfundo took second position in the overall competition. It also received trophies in four categories: Grand March Pass, Best Exhibition, Best Dressed and Best Drum Major.
The march and drill coordinator at the school, Nomawethu Mkhele, said: “The children practise of their own accord three times a week. Some are not strong academically so we encourage them to participate to enjoy the school experience.
“This march and drill extramural activity offered children the chance to learn something and be happy about being at school.
“The children were ecstatic and seeing them so happy made me realise how much these children appreciate little things. For them, the march and drill meant travelling and seeing other towns,” Mkhele said.
“When we got to Cape Town, the children were excited about being in a hotel and sleeping alone in a bed. To them, this was a luxury and an experience they would be able to share with the others who had not gone.”
Visiting Table Mountain and lunching at the V&A Waterfront was certainly a memory the children will treasure all their lives as some had never even dined at a restaurant, Mkhele said

The Booysen Park Primary violin project team organised a memorable trip for its pupils.
The teacher in charge of the project, Michael Alley, said the project started with the late director of the Eastern Cape Philharmonic Orchestra Music Investment Project, Judy Speyers, with the aim to groom young people into future musicians.
Speaking of the Cape Town trip, Alley said: “This was the first time the children boarded a flight, some were very excited while some were nervous as the plane took off. The different expressions gave me such joy as I knew this would give children a sneak peek into a life that was possible to them.”
In total, the trip cost R90 000, but lack of funding did not deter the children from working hard to raise the funds.
Alley said: “We also received individual and generous donations from Summerwood Primary after hearing about this project.
“The children were well received in Cape Town by CBC St Johns Parklands College, where they were invited to perform. The children then had the opportunity to go sightseeing, [which] included activities on Table Mountain, Robben Island and the infamous China Town, where they shopped.”
Booysen Park Grade 5 pupil Kristen Rensburg, 11, said: “When we took off I was scared, but I was excited too. The trip to Cape Town was nice because we learnt about Table Mountain and why it was so high.”
Rensburg’s classmate, Lilitha Ngwane, 11, said: “The trip was awesome. We had lots of fun, we were very busy with activities but what stood out for me was going on the cable cars and the boat trip to Robben Island. Those two things were really awesome.”
