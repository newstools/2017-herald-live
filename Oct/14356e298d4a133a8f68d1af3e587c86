A young Port Elizabeth man accused of murder, as well as the rape of an elderly woman, fired his lawyer yesterday as his pre-trial conference was about to get under way in the Port Elizabeth High Court.
The move saw the 26-year-old’s trial date postponed to the second quarter of next year, meaning he will spend the next six months as an awaiting-trial prisoner.
Family members of the victims sat at the back of the court and sobbed as they heard of the delay.
The body of Bhaven Moodley, 37, a father of two, was discovered in his Malabar home in January last year.
He had been strangled and the house ransacked.


A 66-year-old woman on the premises at the time had also been assaulted and raped.
The young man was arrested along the Summerstrand beachfront after he was spotted driving a black Mercedes-Benz AMG, which was registered in the woman’s name.
He was also allegedly linked to the offence through fingerprints.
At his bail application last year, he indicated that he would plead not guilty to the charges.
He cannot be named until a formal plea has been accepted by the court.
His matter was postponed to April 17 for a new trial date and for Legal Aid SA to appoint a new lawyer to the case.
