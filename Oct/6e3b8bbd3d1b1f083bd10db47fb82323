Country still not ready, rights activists say
Kenya’s Supreme Court will meet today, on the eve of the country’s presidential election rerun, to hear a last-minute petition challenging the ballot. Chief Justice David Maraga, who presided over the annulling of August’s original flawed vote, said he would hear a petition filed by human rights activists arguing Kenya was not ready for tomorrow’s rerun.
“Matter to be heard at 10am tomorrow [today],” Maraga said in a statement.
He said the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC) as well as all the presidential candidates must submit their written submissions before the hearing.
Kenya’s disputed presidential poll has been beset by legal challenges, including one brought by opposition leader Raila Odinga which led to the Supreme Court overturning President Uhuru Kenyatta’s victory on September 1 and ordering a rerun within 60 days.
The Supreme Court’s decision to hear this latest petition, filed on Sunday, raises the possibility that tomorrow’s election may be delayed.
“We are hoping they will cancel elections on October 26,” activist Khelef Khalifa, of Muslims for Human Rights, said.
He filed the petition alongside Samwel Mohochi, of the Kenya branch of the International Commission of Jurists, and Gacheke Gachihi – also known as Nahashon Kamau – of the Mathare Social Justice Centre in Nairobi.
The petitioners cite several arguments for delaying the vote.
They include Odinga’s withdrawal from the rerun two weeks ago which they say means the vote must be cancelled, and the IEBC chairman’s own admission last week that a free, fair and credible election could not be guaranteed, as the constitution demands.
They argue that a delay of up to 90 days should be ordered by the Supreme Court.
The opposition, as well as some analysts, have also called for a delay, but Kenyatta has insisted the vote should go ahead as planned despite Odinga’s boycott and ongoing protests.


In Nairobi yesterday, police used bullets and teargas to disperse a small demonstration as Odinga appeared to row back from a call for his supporters to hold protests during the vote.
In the western city of Kisumu, an Odinga stronghold, about 2 000 demonstrators marched on the election board offices, witnesses said, responding to Odinga’s appeal for protests against the ballot. They dispersed peacefully.
He says it will not be free and fair because the election board has not made sufficient progress in carrying out the reforms he demanded after the August election was annulled.
Odinga had urged his supporters to ensure tomorrow’s vote did not take place, repeatedly saying there would be “no elections”.
But yesterday he told the BBC he was not calling for protests on polling day itself.
“We have not told people to protest on polling day. We have not said that at all. We have told people to stay away,” he said.
When called for clarification, Odinga’s spokesman said he was saying peaceful protests would still take place and that the opposition would fully explain their plans today.
At least 49 people have died in political violence since the August ballot, evoking unwelcome memories of the aftermath of a disputed 2007 poll, when more than 1 200 people were killed.
The political stand-off has also blunted growth in East Africa’s richest economy, a nation valued for its stability and relative freedom in a region roiled by conflict.
Last week, Odinga supporters disrupted at least three official pre-polling events. Police said some election board staff were seriously injured.
