Activists warn against animal cruelty ahead of Guy Fawkes
With the day most dreaded by pets fast approaching, animal activists are urging Bay residents to join hands to protect their pooches.

This was the message being spread at an event held at the Cleary Park Shopping Centre on Stanford Road on Saturday, ahead of Guy Fawkes next weekend.
Usually marked by loud fireworks, Guy Fawkes brings suffering for dogs and cats each year, Patsy Wagner of the Animal Anti-Cruelty League (AACL), who led the awareness campaign, said.
Although the turnout for the event was not as large as she had hoped, Wagner said she would be continuing her efforts to raise awareness throughout the week.
“I think we managed to reach some people, but things are going from bad to worse,” Wagner said.
“In the northern areas, the fireworks for Guy Fawkes last a month, not just one day.
“The streets in Schauderville are already black from fireworks.
“There are still shops selling crackers illegally, even to children.
“The dogs are so scared [when the fireworks go off] and we have to deal with the lost and abandoned pets the next day.”
In one case, the league had to rush a dog to a vet after its paw was ripped apart by a firecracker.


“People seem to think it is cute when a dog runs to the cracker, but it knows a loud noise is coming and wants to smother it.
“This dog put his paw on the cracker. It was horrible. The dog’s leg had to be amputated.”
Wagner said she would be moving from area to area in the week ahead to relay her plea to residents.
“Something really needs to be done. If everyone can just take charge [against fireworks] in their own streets, [it would make a difference].”
The Saturday event also included a demonstration by Marizanne Ferreira, animal rescuer, activist for pitbull rights and campaigner against illegal pitbull breeding.
“The response to the event was positive,” Ferreira said.
“I talked about the bylaws that make unregistered breeding illegal, pointing out that this only brings more stock for [people running pitbull fighting rings].”
Ferreira said she had also warned residents against chaining up their dogs.
“A few of the people in attendance let me chain them to poles and afterwards described the experience as humiliating and frustrating.
“I told them that is exactly how the dogs feel [in the same situation].”
