Samuel Julies came from the bench to score the only goal of the match, taking Chippa United to the next round of the Telkom Knockout Cup after they beat Mamelodi Sundowns 1-0 at Mdantsane’s Sisa Dukashe Stadium yesterday.
The first half thrilled as both sides tried to assert their dominance.
Sundowns’ Thokozani Sekotlong had a go at Daniel Akpeyi in the first 10 minutes, but the experienced keeper kept his cool and made a save.
Abel Mabaso provided a short cross to Paseka Mako, who missed the ball.
Kurt Lentjies managed to dribble past the Brazilian defence and found Lerato Manzini.
Khama Billiat and Percy Tau did all they could to reach the Chilli Boys’ turf, but Phetso Maphanga and James Okwuosa stood their ground.
Downs had a free kick taken by Tau himself, but it did not produce the desired result as he hit a Chilli Boys brick wall.
Both sides wanted to score but not concede in the first half.
Hachi Fares missed a clear shot when the ball missed the posts by centimetres. Akpeyi was working overtime compared with Onyango as the African champions knocked on their door, but Chippa took the fight to the Chloorkop outfit as Mako went far into their turf for a one-on-one with Onyango.
However, the linesman signalled that he was offside.
The absence of Mike Mayambela made no difference, as Mpho Mvelase and Sizwe Mndlindzo kept up the pressure on the Brazilians.
Nonetheless Tau was desperate to catch the Chilli Boys off-guard as he kept Okwuosa busy.


The first half ended in a stalemate as neither side found an opening.
The second half promised to be a spectacle.
Madisha thought he had scored an opening goal for Downs five minutes into the second half when he shot straight to the far side. The Chilli Boys keeper went to it, but the goal was disallowed.
Themba Zwane missed a golden opportunity as he penetrated Chippa’s midfield to find himself in the box, but the defenders were having none of it.
Manzini was replaced by Samuel Julies, who opened the score 10 minutes into the second half after receiving a beautiful square from Mvelase, who got a through pass from Paseka Mako after the midfielder passed the Downs centres to score.
Lentjies and Julies terrorised Bangaly Soumahoro, who was doing his best to help Onyango.
Chippa replaced Lentjies with centre defender Kristopher Bergman.
Mako could have taken a second goal for the Chilli Boys when Downs defenders locked him down in the box, but the ball was deflected back to Mabaso, who also failed to score.
Leonardo Castro missed a header when he received a corner kick from Billiat, as his ball was to the far right of the poles.
Castro then went into the box with Tau, but Maphanga was there to secure the Chilli Boys’ turf.
In yesterday’s other match, Baroka FC beat Cape Town City 1-0. Quarterfinals draw:
Chippa United v Kaizer Chiefs, Orlando Pirates v Polokwane City, Platinum Stars v Bloemfontein Celtic, Wits v Baroka.
