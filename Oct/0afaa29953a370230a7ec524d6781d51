Commercial farmers are 4.5 times as likely to get murdered as the South African population as a whole.
This is according to civil rights group AfriForum‚ which released its latest statistics on attacks and murders on farms in Centurion yesterday.
It said 156 commercial farmers were killed per 100 000 people.
According to the police’s annual crime statistics – released on Tuesday – 34.1 South Africans are murdered per 100 000 of the population.
AfriForum recorded 70 murders and 357 attacks on farms last year.
That was an increase from the 48 murders recorded in 2011.
Deputy chief executive Ernst Roets said the rights group was being deliberately conservative in its numbers.
“We only add murder cases we can verify, so when we say 70, it means we have a list of 70 people that have been murdered,” Roets said.


AfriForum criminologist Lorraine Claasen said there had been 70 murders on farms so far this year, and that there was usually a spike over November and December.
She conceded that some farmers mistreated farm workers‚ but said this was not a reason to isolate and decry farmers and people in rural communities as criminals, when they were also murdered and attacked.
There have been eight attacks and two murders on South African farms in the last six days.
Kyle Stols was murdered on Sunday during a burglary on a farm close to Jagersfontein in the Free State.
His brother, Gawie, said: “He had his whole life ahead of him – he did not get the chance to have maybe a first‚ second or third girlfriend. “It’s mundane things we accept.”
Claasen said the lives of farmers were not worth more than someone living in the city‚ but “people living in the cities do not plant the vegetables that we are going to eat tomorrow”.
Crime-fighting non-profit Heritage Protection Group director Steven Vermaak warned farmers to be wary of the person they trusted the most.
“The person who stores cash on their farms and does not hold it on them in person‚ make a plan‚” Vermaak said.
“Open your safe, so that they can know what is in there.
“Everyone thinks there is something behind that nice place that you secure.”
