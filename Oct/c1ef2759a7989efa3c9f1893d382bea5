A municipal security officer assigned to Nqaba Bhanga has been involved in an accident in which two other people diedPicture: Supplied
The DA’s Eastern Cape leader, Nqaba Bhanga, has confirmed that a municipal security officer assigned to him was involved in an accident in which two people were killed on Saturday night.
While Bhanga said he could not reveal the driver’s identity, he confirmed the man was in a critical condition at St George’s Hospital.
Bhanga said he had been told yesterday a jikeleza taxi had driven into the man’s Chevrolet when it [the jikeleza] ran a red traffic light on Sipondo Road at the corner of Missionvale and Kenako Mall.
“I was told that two people died . . . I was supposed to be there. Thank God I wasn’t there.”
Bhanga also revealed the driver had been transporting his girlfriend to him as he had been hosting guests from Cape Town.


He said he had spent the whole of yesterday visiting police stations in the township trying to figure out what had happened. As far as he knew, no alcohol had been involved. Mayor Athol Trollip said last night it was the first he had heard of the incident.
“I’ve been in two meetings with Nqaba this week. I cannot comment as I don’t know about this.”
City manager Johann Mettler said: “[The accident] was reported to the administration and the police. I am awaiting details on the deceased.”
While the ANC and the EFF reacted with shock to the news last night, the UDM said it was aware of the accident. The parties sent their condolences to the families of the deceased.
Bay ANC regional spokesman Gift Ngqondi said: “This should be investigated so we know what transpired and why the car was [in use] at that time.”
Police spokesman Captain Johan Rheeder was unable to assist with information late last night and said he could only follow it up today.
