 Chippa United defender James Okwuosa celebrated his 100th game for the club last weekendPicture: Supplied
Former skipper dreams of Caf glory for his club
Chippa United defender and former skipper James Okwuosa is the first player to reach a 100 starts for the club in the Premier Soccer League, but he says his biggest dream is to see Chippa play in the Caf and Champions League one day.

Okwuosa was awarded with his framed 100th shirt last weekend ahead of the league game against Cape Town City, and what better way to seal the deal than with a crucial and well-fought 2-1 win on the day.
“The milestone was not something I was targeting. It came as a surprise because I was aspiring to get a bigger achievement.
“I am not saying this is not a big achievement – it’s a good thing that I really appreciate. I am honoured and I really thank God for it,” he said.
“I wasn’t counting my games. It was Luthando who came to me and said, ‘Do you know this is your 100th game in the PSL for Chippa?’ and I was like ‘wow’.
“I was really excited and getting the win on the same day I received my 100th cap for the club was a good thing. It’s a good thing to happen in anybody’s career.”
The 27-year-old Nigerian player has been with the Chilli Boys since 2012, on loan from Ajax Cape Town, and was signed by the club the following year.
At the beginning of the year Okwuosa had a short stint at Orlando Pirates, but later returned to Chippa on loan after things did not go well in the Sea Robbers camp, having only made one appearance for the club.


The former Enugu Rangers IFC player said he was like part of the Chippa furniture as he knew the club inside out.
“My stay at the club has been okay. I have come a really long way with this team and I understand how things are done here.
“It’s a good thing when you play for Chippa United – it’s a place where you can relate to people. It’s like home to me,” he said.
“Being the first player at the club to reach this milestone feels great.
“I think it is a good example for the youngsters, those who are coming up to see that there are greater things ahead.
“It’s good leaving a good legacy. I hope this will encourage them (young players) to work harder, be dedicated, disciplined and honestly that is what it takes to get here.
“If they can do all those things I think they can achieve it too,” he said. The father of two attributes his good form throughout the year to three main pillars: dedication, discipline and honesty.
“I think what has helped me to achieve things is firstly by the grace of God and secondly it was hard work.
“I just had to stretch my body and being disciplined also helped a lot. Those are the attributes that added to make it and get this achievement.
“It’s just all about knowing how to live your life and how you keep yourself and stay strong, fast and healthy so you can be able to play.”
So what can we expect from Okwuosa in the future at Chippa?
“I just want to be better than I was yesterday and try to help the team achieve a trophy. I want to see this club playing in the Caf and the Champions League – that is my big dream for Chippa.
“It has been my dream since the first day I joined the club. Even if I leave here, I believe, and I know, that the team will get there one day.
“I just want to say a special thank you to the chairman, Siviwe Mpengesi, who has believed in me and also to the fans – they are the reason why we keep on going.
“They shouldn’t stop supporting us, we, on our side, will continue to try and do our best to give them the good results they require from us.”
