A municipal security officer assigned to Nqaba Bhanga has been involved in an accident in which two other people diedPicture: Supplied
An internal investigation by the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality following the death of two people involved in a crash with a municipal vehicle last week is still ongoing.
A security officer assigned to DA Eastern Cape leader Nqaba Bhanga was involved in the fatal accident in Zwide.
Close protection officer Kgothatso Moshele was critically injured while a 17-year-old man died on the scene and a 45-year-old woman died later in hospital.
Moshele was on his way to collect Bhanga’s girlfriend.


The investigation was meant to be completed yesterday but municipal manager Johann Mettler said the driver had not yet been interviewed.
“Technical data is also still outstanding from the tracker such as speed and braking,” he said.
“We do not have access to our vehicle yet as there is an ongoing police investigation and therefore we can’t download tracker information as a result.”
Police spokeswoman Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said police were investigating a case of culpable homicide.
“Investigations are still ongoing.”
