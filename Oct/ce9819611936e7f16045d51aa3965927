SuperSport United coach Eric Tinkler is hoping for highly experienced referees with no fear during the two-legged Caf Confederations Cup final against TP Mazembe next month.
United travel to the home of the Confederations Cup defending champions and former Caf Champions League winners in Lubumbashi in the DRC on the weekend of November 17-19 and host them in the second leg at the Lucas Moripe Stadium the following weekend.
Tinkler‚ who was in charge of Orlando Pirates two years ago when they were beaten 2-1 on aggregate by Etoile du Sahel in the final of the competition‚ said he remembered what happened in Lubumbashi when he was there with the Bucs.
“You need a very good and experienced referee‚ especially against a team like TP Mazembe‚ because I know what happened there the last time when I was with Pirates‚” Tinkler said.
“You need a referee who has no fear and that is very‚ very important, because going to Mazembe you have heard stories in the past‚ and we hope that those things don’t happen this year.”
Tinkler was speaking at OR Tambo airport yesterday afternoon shortly after United arrived from Tunisia‚ where they beat Club Africain 3-1 in the second leg of the Confed semifinal in Rades on Sunday night and 4-2 on aggregate‚ after a 1-1 home draw.
The coach said that part of his job in the build-up to the final was to have his players remain fully focused on what is controllable in terms of preparations and on the pitch during the match‚ and not to worry too much about match officials.
“For the players‚ they must just focus on the field because there are certain things you can’t control between those four lines‚” he said.
“As a collective, we have to give our best with regards to our preparations and on the field and not be affected by a bad decision here and there.”


United will travel to Lubumbashi in the first leg without key defender Morgan Gould and veteran creative midfielder Reneilwe Letsholonyane‚ who are suspended for the clash‚ and Tinkler will have to find able replacements.
“‘Yeye’ [Letsholonyane] and Morgan unfortunately are suspended, but I thought Tefu Mashamaite was exceptional when he came on because he showed great composure at a stage when we needed it‚ and I have no fear with him coming in as a replacement for Morgan‚” the coach said.
“In the midfield‚ it is going to be difficult to replace Yeye because we don’t really have another one who is like him because of his experience and his creativity. Sipho Mbule is probably the closest we have.”
Meanwhile, SuperSport United chairman Khulu Sibiya has described what Tinkler and players achieved in Tunisia this weekend as an overwhelming experience and a remarkable milestone in the history of the club.
“I’ve always had a smile on my face ever since this club started. I’ve been smiling and it’s even worse now‚” Sibiya said in his speech welcoming the team at the OR Tambo Airport yesterday.
“This to me is the biggest moment – and not only for the club but for the country as well. It’s just overwhelming.
“It is the greatest of milestones‚ what we have achieved. It is something we will cherish for a very long‚ long time.”
Sibiya singled out club chief executive Stanley Matthews for insisting on bringing Tinkler and captain Dean Furman to SuperSport.
“Eric, you’ve done an amazing job. You came to this club and made things happen. You’re an amazing‚ amazing man‚” Sibiya said.
“Thanks to you, Stan, for dropping the name of Eric [when United were looking for a replacement for Stuart Baxter].”
