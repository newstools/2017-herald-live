A 27-year-old man was arrested after he was found with counterfeit goods to the estimated value of R200 000 in his possession.
According to police, property-related crimes in Nelson Mandela Bay have forced them to focus on the main transport routes in and out of Nelson Mandela Bay in order to police the supply and transport lines of stolen and counterfeit goods.
Kinkelbos police were patrolling and monitoring the N2 leading in and out of Nelson Mandela Bay this morning when they spotted a very suspicious white Toyota Quantum panel van driving without registration plates.
The vehicle was pulled over and on investigation, police found suspicious cargo items on the vehicle. The vehicle and contents was taken to Kinkelbos station where customs officials identified the goods as counterfeit to the estimated value of R200 000.
The goods, 180 boxes of sanitary pads and 29 boxes of yeast were being transported from Johannesburg to Nelson Mandela Bay.
The suspect will be appearing in Alexandria Magistrate’s Court on Monday 30 October 2017 on a charge of possession of counterfeit goods.
