The Nelson Mandela Bay municipality is on a mission to secure funding to the tune of R1.5-million to train law enforcement officers to clamp down on illegal dumping over the next year.
Bay mayor Athol Trollip made the announcement at a public health committee meeting yesterday.
Cleaning up illegal dumping sites is among the top priorities of the War on Waste litter picking programme, which is in its second phase.
The first phase failed to yield the desired outcome and had its budget cut from R15-million to R7-million following alleged political meddling.
The city is still waiting for the final PricewaterHouseCoopers report into the matter.
“The appeal has been that we employ between 18 and 20 people who we will train to become law enforcement officers for illegal dumping and assist us in this war on waste,” Trollip said.
He said they hoped to initiate a legal process that would allow them to skip bid adjudication and employ rangers from identified wards.
The committee needed to initiate a legal process of using money considered as value added tax, he said.


“Illegal dumping is an issue in some wards – we want to put these people in these wards so they can help us with the war on waste project.
“This is a conditional grant; we have to employ new people so they can get skills as well. These people will work as rangers alongside the metro police,” Trollip said.
ANC councillor Ncediso Captain said he hoped the project would target disadvantaged areas.
“This must focus on disadvantaged areas and the people employed must be from the northern areas and townships.”
ANC councillor Queenie Pink suggested the city use peace officers to pick up litter at illegal dumping sites and use the money for something else.
“I’m not opposed to job creation, but why don’t we use peace officers as we have already made that investment through training them?”
The project comes as the city prepares to finalise plans to appoint cooperatives for litter picking in the townships.
Municipal official Annalisa Dyakala said the municipality was drawing up monthly memorandums of understanding for the cooperatives.
