 Chippa United will be looking to break their Telkom Knockout hoodoo when they host African Champions Mamelodi Sundowns in a last-16 fixture at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane on Sunday (3.30pm).

The Chilli Boys have not passed the last-16 stage of the competition since joining the Premier Soccer League.
Having successfully reached the MTN8 and Nedbank Cup semifinals, the TKO is the only cup competition in which Chippa has never gone past the first stage, and caretaker coach Teboho Moloi will be out to break that duck.


When the Port Elizabeth side gained their first promotion to the big league in the 2012-13 season, they were knocked out in the first stage by Bloemfontein Celtic after losing 2-1.
Upon their return to the PSL during the 2014-15 season, Chippa lost 1-0 to Platinum Stars and the following season they were beaten 2-0 by Sundowns.
Last season, their journey in the TKO was cut short by Highland Park after losing 2-0.
Their match against Masandawana will not be an easy one as the Pretoria side will be out to reclaim their trophy after they failed to defend it last season, losing 3-1 on penalties to SuperSport United in the quarterfinals.
To win against Pitso Mosimane’s troops on Sunday, the Chilli Boys will have to bring the same zeal and hard work they portrayed when they overpowered Cape Town City in a crucial league game at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium, at the weekend.
Chippa have a good record at the Mdantsane stadium and will also be counting on home ground advantage when they take on Kabo Yellow.
The team welcome back Paseka Mako, who has been out for two weeks due to a foot injury.
The former Cape Town All Stars winger missed both home league matches against Maritzburg United and Cape Town City.
His return will be a confidence boost for the team ahead of the TKO fixture.
According to the Chippa website, the club’s medical team are keeping a close eye on Katlego Mashego and Sandile Zuke, who both suffered injuries in their game against Cape Town City.
Tickets for the game are already on sale at Ticket Pro outlets at R40 (adults) and R15 (children under the age of 12).
