The Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality acknowledged yesterday that communities were bearing the brunt of service delivery disruptions due to officials being unhappy with amendments to the overtime policy.
Corporate affairs boss Vuyo Zitumane said the municipality was compelled to review the policy after it emerged that overtime was incorrectly applied for a number of years.
“As a result, a significant portion of the annual budget was paid irregularly to employees above the prescribed annual salary threshold,” Zitumane said.
The amendments were meant to address the irregularities but had instead been met with resistance by some municipal staff.
Zitumane said at no time had the municipality flouted the Basic Conditions of Employment Act in its review of the overtime policy.


Amendments made to the policy included:

Employees earning less than R205 433 a year would be compensated in terms of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act;
In the case of emergencies all qualifying employees, excluding directors, would be remunerated in terms of the employment act; and
All employees above the annual salary threshold would be paid on a straight-line basis, except in case of emergencies.

Zitumane said the municipality would also not tolerate the sabotage of service delivery by disgruntled employees.
The municipality would institute criminal and internal investigations to identify and act against those involved.
