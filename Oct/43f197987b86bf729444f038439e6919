Chippa United is still waiting for an official “divorce” letter from the Buffalo City Municipality (BCM) regarding their partnership with East London, chief operations officer Lukhanyo Mzinzi said.
This comes after BCM mayor Xola Pakati told councillors on Wednesday that Buffalo City’s relationship with the Port Elizabeth Premier Soccer League side was unsustainable.
BCM resolved not to extend its partnership with Chippa United for the 2017-18, 2018-19 and 2019-20 financial years when the metro would have paid the club a reported R1.3million a game.
Chippa are said to have bagged R1-million a game. The plan was to play five games in East London this season.
Mzinzi said yesterday the news came as a shock, because BCM had been fixing the Sisa Dukashe Stadium in Mdantsane to make it a suitable facility for their games.
“We are taken aback as a club, because the last time we checked, as management, we were on the same page as the Buffalo City Municipality.
“They were happy with our reports and from the onset of the season when the mayor was speaking at the state of the city address, we believed that we were part of the development.
“We are awaiting a formal notice or letter from the city notifying us that our relationship has ended,” Mzinzi said.
“Like everybody else, we had just seen the news in a newspaper [yesterday].
“If it is true, it’s a pity for the Eastern Cape.


“It’s a pity for the people who believe in the club and for the young kids who aspire to be professional players who were motivated by this partnership.
“But we are going to wait for the city to communicate with us.”
Chippa boss Siviwe “Chippa” Mpengesi said he would foot the bill to take Chippa games to Buffalo City.
He would use his own money to ensure the fans can continue to watch the team live.
A disappointed Mpengesi told The Herald’s sister paper, Daily Dispatch, that the club had been a victim of political infighting.
“Chippa will not leave East London – whether it’s supported by the municipality or not.
“We are here for our vision – which is to revive the good old days of football. I will not be deterred,” the owner said.
“So, the more support our fans show us during this difficult time, the better things will be for us as a team.”
Chippa United arrive in East London today for their Telkom Knockout game against Mamelodi Sundowns at the Sisa Dukashe Stadium on Sunday.
“Fans should come out in their numbers,” Mpengesi said.
