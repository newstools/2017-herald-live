Chippa United coach Teboho Moloi has asked his players to put their hearts on the line when they face Kaizer Chiefs in the Telkom Knockout last eight at the Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium in Port Elizabeth on Sunday.
After seeing off Mamelodi Sundowns 1-0 in the last 16 of the KO Cup in Mdantsane on Sunday, the Chilli Boys face another daunting task when they host the Soweto giants.
Samuel Julies helped Chippa advance to the next round of the competition when he found the back of the net in the second half.
Caretaker coach Moloi seems to have turned Chippa United’s fortunes around and has asked his players to give their all against Amakhosi on Sunday, from 3.30pm.
“It is a very difficult game. I know, I come from the rivals [Orlando Pirates] and that’s always in my heart.
“They [Kaizer Chiefs] will always be my rivals,” Moloi said.
“There is no way that we are going to face them and not fight.


“But we need to play as well,” the former Pirates midfielder said.
His team had to fight for every inch against Sundowns, he said.
“It was a difficult win, we can’t take anything away from Sundowns. “They gave us a run for our money. “It was an exciting game, it could have gone either way because both teams never sat back. “We were attacking each other.” Moloi would like nothing more than to beat his old rivals, but before he navigates that match he needs to plot a path to victory over Wits at the Bidvest Stadium in Johannesburg in the PSL tomorrow night.
Moloi has not lost a game at Chippa since taking over from Dan Malesela and attributes his seven-match unbeaten run to hard work.
“I had to shut the door first [in defence]. Going forward, this team never had problems, but in the past when they went forward, they went with numbers and were not aware of what was happening behind them. “We had to work on that one first. “Everything goes with hard work, these boys are prepared to dig in and work very hard,” he said.
“We are not a finished product yet, we are a product at work. We still need to work hard to be able to change from defence to attack.”
