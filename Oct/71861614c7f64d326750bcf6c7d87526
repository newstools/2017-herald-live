Three Port Elizabeth agencies presenting final branding ideas for the Ironman 70.3 World Championships
Preparations for the Ironman 70.3 World Championships are gearing up, with three Port Elizabeth agencies presenting final branding ideas to the mayoral committee yesterday.
The city has until the end of the month to present a branding campaign to Ironman SA before the event in September next year.
Boomtown, SimonSays and Strategy Branding Imagineers pitched designs centred on Nelson Mandela, wildlife, an Ndebele woman and the city’s culture to the mayoral committee yesterday.
Sports, recreation, arts and culture executive director Noxolo Nqwazi said they hoped to use the logo and branding beyond the two-day event.
Nqwazi would not say how much had been set aside for the branding, but it would form part of the R500 000 operational budget for the event.
SimonSays director Simon le Gras said there were iconic symbols that represented Nelson Mandela Bay.
“We identified wildlife to be quite a prominent one, and we also found Madiba came out strongly,” Le Gras said.


“We also looked at the cultural aspect and in terms of our heritage.”
His team presented four logos of the M-dot Ironman icon along with the word Molo [hello] to the committee.
Boomtown managing director Andrew Mackenzie presented two logos with Wamkeleki [loosely translated as welcome] being the tag line.
Strategy Branding Imagineers director Mathew Swarbrick presented three logos, opting to personalise the branding with the face of an Ndebele woman.
The committee was given seven days to choose the branding, which will be used on T-Shirts and backpacks for athletes.
Mayor Athol Trollip commended the graphic designers for a job well done.
“I liked the logos and I had goose-bumps when I saw them.
“We have nine logos to choose from and it requires that we apply our minds,” he said.
