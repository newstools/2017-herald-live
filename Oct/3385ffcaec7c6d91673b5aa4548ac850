Lusty Proteas left-hander speeds into history books with help of seven fours and nine sixes
David Andrew Miller! Who do you think you are, breaking world records in what should have been a sleepy Sunday afternoon in Potchefstroom? South Africa’s lusty‚ lively lefthander came to the crease with only half the innings left in the second T20 against Bangladesh‚ and saw a catch dropped off the first ball he faced.

He might also have been taken out of the equation – in two different ways with a single delivery – for a mere 18.
But‚ after 35 deliveries had been bowled to him‚ Miller raised his bat to celebrate conquering not only his maiden century in the format at this level but also the fastest yet scored in internationals in the format.
Miller raced into cricket’s history books with the help of seven fours and nine sixes – or more than 80% of his undefeated 101.
That took South Africa to a total of 224/4.
Bangladesh were dismissed for 141 in 18.3 overs to give the home side victory by 83 runs and with that the distinction of having won every match they played against a touring team for the first time since games were played in all three formats in this country‚ in 2005-06.
South Africa won both tests by large margins before reeling off a hat-trick of victories in the OneDay internationals and adding successes in the two T20s.
But‚ for a while there yesterday‚ it looked as if Bangladesh might not go home with a dismally clean sheet.
After 9.5 overs, South Africa were 78/3 with Mangaliso Mosehle‚ JP Duminy and AB de Villiers all dismissed. If the home side were going to set a decent target‚ Hashim Amla would surely have to do most of the setting.
He was 49 not out and going unusually aggressively when De Villiers was caught in the deep for 20. That was when Miller strode to the middle.
Seven overs later, Amla hammered a catch down deep cover’s throat to go for his bristling 85‚ which took him 51 balls and featured 11 fours and a six.


Miller was 42 not out at that stage and there were only 21 balls left in the innings. Could he get himself to a century before the umpires cried mercy?
Hell yes. Miller needed just 15 deliveries to reap the remaining 58 runs – 31 of them in one spectacular over from seamer Mohammad Saifuddin.
The first ball disappeared wide over the long-on fence for six.
The second cleared the cover boundary for another half- dozen.
Miller sent the third screaming into the crowd beyond square leg: six.
A panicked Saifuddin veered down leg with the fourth ball‚ and Miller helped it over the fine leg ropes: six.
Ball five was dropped short‚ which was Miller’s cue for a mighty pull: six.
But Saifuddin put his last‚ whimpering offering wide outside off-stump.
And all Miller could do was spear it along the ground into the covers for a single‚ which elicited disappointment.
His ordeal at last done‚ Saifuddin collected his cap from the umpire‚ used it to cover his face‚ and walked slowly into the outfield‚ beaten and bowed.
It was almost cruel to send the shellshocked Bangladeshis out to bat after that‚ and they duly capitulated. Opener Soumya Sarkar’s 47 was the best effort.
JP Duminy and Aaron Phangiso took two wickets each.
