 Sipho ‘Big Fish’ Makhabane made a turn in Port Elizabeth to promote his new album
It is a set of three self-set rules that have kept gospel music legend Sipho “Big Fish” Makhabane in the game for 29 years, he said while promoting his newly released album in the Eastern Cape last week.
“The three things that will take you far in life is to love what you are doing, believe in what you are doing and be a hard worker. That’s all.”
Makhabane was in Port Elizabeth to promote his latest offering Sinekhaya (We Have A Home), released on October 20.
On the 13-track album, The Devil Is a Liar hitmaker features Zimbabwean jazz legend Oliver Mtukudzi in the song Tinotenda, and prophet TA Ralekholela in Save Women & Children.
Sinekhaya is the legend’s 33rd album since joining the industry.
Makhabane said Save Women & Children was inspired by the recent reports of abductions and killings of women and children. The song was an appeal to fellow men to protect them.
“I did the song after the outcries about women and child abuse in the country and I asked the prophet to assist me in sending this message to our brothers – to remind them that it’s our duty as men to protect and not harm our women and children.”
Makhabane said the album was generally about highlighting the challenges faced by South Africa while encouraging and motivating its citizens at the same time.
“It’s also just a way of thanking my loyal supporters who have been with me for the past 32 albums.”
The multi award-winning gospel music veteran has discovered some of the country’s best-known gospel musicians, including Hlengiwe Mhlaba, Thobekile, Malibongwe Gcwabe and gospel group Ncandweni Christ Ambassadors.
With more than two decades in the industry and an attempt at retirement, Makhabane said he no longer had plans to retire anytime soon.
The singer had announced his retirement in 2010, stating he would focus on grooming talent under his record label, Big Fish Music, but returned to work soon after.
“My supporters would not let me retire. I once met an old man who asked me how I could retire without the consent of the people who buy and listen to my music. They had not had enough of my music.
“I was in a car accident in 2014, which left me in a coma for six days. So now I don’t know where I will end up but I will continue doing the work of God.
“Retirement will happen when it happens,” he said.
Sinekhaya is available at music stores countrywide and online for download.
