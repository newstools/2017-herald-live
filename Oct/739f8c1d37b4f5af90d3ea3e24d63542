A single tot of this whisky costs R18 000 at a Cape Town hotel
Fancy paying the price of a small house for a bottle of whisky?
This year’s Makro Christmas brochure got tongues wagging with its R650 000 price tag for a bottle of Glenlivet 50-year-old Speyside single malt.
But‚ if you do not feel like paying the price of two family sedans for a bottle of whisky‚ you can make your way down to the Cape Grace hotel at the V&A Waterfront in Cape Town.
A single tot of Glenfiddich 50-year-old costs R18 000 at the hotel’s Bascule Whisky‚ Wine and Cocktail Bar. A whole bottle will set you back R600 000 at Makro
Bascule bar manager Victor Kirkbridge explained the attraction of such an expensive drink and what type of clientele usually went for it.
“It varies. Sometimes it’s travellers who are familiar with the products and their rarity‚ or locals who decide to go for the unique opportunity of tasting rare whisky.”


Kirkbridge said recently a group of men had visited the bar for a few evenings and polished off some very rare whiskies from distilleries that were no longer producing them.
“We have also had people buy expensive vintages‚ which are sometimes the year of their birth‚ such as recently the 1953 54-year-old Glenfarclas‚ which costs R12 500 per tot‚” he said.
Makro liquor director Jonathan Koff said the retailer had sold a number of pricey bottles‚ but none of the six-figure stuff this year so far.
“This year we have sold one bottle of Hennessy Richard cognac and nine bottles of Remy Martin Louis XIII at R55 000 a bottle‚” he said.
Some buy to consume‚ others to build a collection.
Neil Paterson, co-owner of Whisky Brother in Hyde Park, said whisky could be seen as an investment‚ but buying a premier bottle like the Glenlivet might not be the best option.
“You are far better off buying a limited release‚ something single-cask‚ for around R3 000 and selling it again two or three years later for R15 000,” he said.
