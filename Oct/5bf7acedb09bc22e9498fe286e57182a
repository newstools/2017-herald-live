Two convicted killers who abducted and strangled a woman in Storms River before dumping her body in the bush have been sentenced to life imprisonment.
Louis Baardman, 36, and Phillip Nel, 41, were arrested in 2014 for the murder of Ina Marincowitz, 59, whose body was found in the bush alongside the N2 while her car – a Chevrolet Spark – was on its roof several kilometres away, having being crashed by the killers in a police chase.
The men had abducted Marincowitz – who had recently moved to Storms River from Cape Town – from her home, strangled her and dumped her body before crashing her car.
The case was heard in the Storms River Regional Court, with Baardman and Nel – who worked for Marincowitz – being sentenced on Monday to life imprisonment for murder and receiving a further 15 years for robbery.
Police spokesman Sergeant Majola Nkohli said that during the trial the court heard how Marincowitz was first assaulted before her body was dumped in the bush.


“The two men stole Marincowitz’s motor vehicle, clothing and other household items valued at around R80 000 and fled the scene.”
It was a random check by police on the occupants of the car that led to their arrest.
“On the same day, a police patrol vehicle spotted the vehicle on the N2 and tried to pull it off the road but it sped off and they gave chase,” Nkohli said.
“The vehicle overturned about 15km outside Storms River and police later found it was stolen and linked to Marincowitz’s murder.”
Humansdorp Cluster commander Brigadier John Lebok said: “This will send out a strong message to those contemplating such horrendous deeds to refrain from them.”
