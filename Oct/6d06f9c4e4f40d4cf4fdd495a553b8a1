Diverse feeling for Sharks coach with loss – and reuniting of sons
Predictably, the Currie Cup rugby final yielded mixed emotions for the Du Preez family. Father Robert‚ the head coach of the Sharks‚ and sons Robert jnr, the Western Province flyhalf‚ and backrow twins Jean-Luc and Dan were the focus of much prematch attention – but in the end there was only one winner.

“As the game went on, Rob got stronger and stronger‚” beaming Western Province coach John Dobson said after his side’s 33-21 Currie Cup win‚ slightly against the odds.
“Rob came to me at half time and said, ‘don’t worry‚ we’ve got this’‚” Dobson recounted a chat with his flyhalf, after WP scored a crucial try just before the half-time whistle.
Dobson had come in for some stick for playing Du Preez ahead of the free-spirited Damian Willemse, who has been doing duty at fullback. The coach felt a little vindication. “I don’t want to sit here and crow but the plan worked really well‚” Dobson said. He was then reminded of how big a loss Du Preez would be when he reunites with his siblings at the Sharks in Durban next season.
“Is Rob joining the Sharks‚ is he? I’m really sorry to hear that‚” Dobson quipped.
“He and Huw Jones were incredible over the last few weeks. Rob is going to be special for them.”
Du Preez snr half grudgingly acknowledged his son’s strong hand in the outcome.
“I thought he played really well‚ especially in the second half. He controlled the game like a general.
“That was the difference between the two sides. WP controlled the game a lot better.
“Their game management was a lot better than ours.
“We are pleased that Rob is coming to the Sharks. That will help us with our stocks at flyhalf. “He’ll be a big asset.” That observation came after a match in which the defensive frailties of Sharks flyhalf Curwin Bosch were ruthlessly exposed by WP.
“We’ve worked really hard on Curwin and his one-on-one defence‚” Du Preez said. “It’s definitely an area of his game that he is going to have to work hard on‚ especially playing international rugby.”
Bosch is only 20 – and he will bounce back from Saturday’s Currie Cup final setback.
His potential move to fullback next season is not the only change at the stunned Sharks.


Assistant coaches Sean Everitt and Ryan Strudwick are believed to be leaving their posts, with the former likely to take the reins of one of the Sharks’ age group teams. It was a Currie Cup final on which Jean-Luc and Dan du Preez will not reflect with fondness.
The former left the field with what looked like a serious ankle injury in the 22nd minute. “It was a big loss‚” his coach said. “It was an ankle injury. I’m not too sure how bad it is.
“We’ll do x-rays and have a clearer picture,” Du Preez said.
Dan was yellow-carded in the 70th minute.
“A yellow card in a final always comes with a cost,” Du Preez said.
“At that time‚ technically we were still in the game. To lose a guy then for 10 minutes, creates more momentum for the opposition.”
Ultimately though‚ WP’s grunt upfront broke the Sharks’ back.
Dobson gave a message to the men in suits who run the game.
“Maybe we get blinded by the occasions, thinking everything is okay with the Currie Cup,” he said.
“I think the tournament has some challenges that need addressing. You see the passion.
“It’s a special tournament. We must have a look at the first weeks of the tournament.
“It was tough for the Lions overlapping with Super Rugby‚ Wednesday fixtures‚ that sort of stuff.
“SA Rugby will be doing [the game] a great disservice if we don’t improve it,” Dobson said.
“Once tradition [Currie Cup] goes‚ it’s gone. We can’t let it go.
“We have to fix it before it gets too bad – like Metro Rail.”
