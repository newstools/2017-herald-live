The medium-term budget policy statement usually passes with little pomp, unlike the annual Treasury speech in February when the government unveils its spending plans for the financial year and those to follow.
However, today’s “mini budget”, as it has come to be known, assumes greater significance than usual.
There is no doubt the country is on the edge of a fiscal cliff. Things have seldom appeared as bleak as they do right now, and yet threaten to continue on this perilous slide.
Our debt burden mounts, state-owned enterprises are sucking up what’s left of our sovereign earnings, economic growth is dire and the state is under duress from ak le ptoc ra tic class of politically connected parasites.
So it doesn’t bear mentioning that our prospects are visibly wan.
Into this breach steps Finance Minister Malusi Gigaba, a man yet to convince the nation of his pedigree for this portfolio, not to mention his predisposition towards President Jacob Zuma’s pro-Gupta project.
Even if Gigaba was beyond reproach, and possessed of a competency without compare, his task this afternoon has a waft of inevitable defeat about it.
The ratings agencies, poised as ever to recalibrate our credit standing, are no doubt on full watch, looking for any sign to wield the axe.


Markets are similarly on edge.
The best Gigaba can hope to do is inspire confidence. Investors love certainty.
But his back is against the wall. Treasury’s earlier revenue projections look set to fall woefully short, possibly by as much as R60-billion.
Additional pressures on the cost base are imminent with public sector wage negotiations on the horizon and what seems to be Zuma’s last stand on the nuclear deal.
Further tax hikes look a dead cert next year; hopefully Gigaba’s speech will give some guidance in this regard.
Raising taxes, however, is a sure-fire brake on growth.
Too much is being asked of consumers already.
What will be very telling is just how much Zuma has forced Gigaba’s hand and whether the minister has pushed back enough for South Africa to live another day.
