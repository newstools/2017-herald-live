 For almost every triathlete, Saturdays are dedicated to long rides, often from as early as 4am.

These rides can be anything between 90 minutes and five hours long.
This past Saturday would be different for me as I had to cut it short.
You see, what makes us triathletes different is probably our obsessivecompulsive nature.
We are creatures of habit and always in pursuit of near perfection.
If you give us a one-hour run session, we will even run around the parking lot until our training watch says one hour done, not 59 minutes.
I cut my session short to catch my nine-year-old daughter’s first-ever competitive swimming gala.
She would be out there in her lane against girls from other local schools. It was a big day Daddy could not afford to miss.
Legs smashed from a shortened ride, I found myself in the second row behind very cheerful and excited parents and grannies.
First up were the eight-year-andunder boys and girls. The little ones took to the 25m pool, churning out impressive lap-times to the admiration and joy of their families and schoolmates.
In absolute awe, I wondered, where I would be now as a triathlete if I had started swimming at eight.
I thought about my Team Tissink mates who typically do double the distance I do in the same time.


Clearly, they had an early start. What I was witnessing is what they were busy with more than 25 years ago.
Learning to swim at 36 and hoping to match people who started when they were eight is unrealistic. You cannot catch up on 25 years of swimming in four years at 41.
If like me you grew up in the townships, you’ll have heard the older folk tell you that swimming or cycling zizinto zabelungu (they’re for white people).
By perpetuating this stereotype, we were taught to believe that we black people cannot swim.
Even worse, legends and myths around rivers or the oceans robbed us of great opportunities due to the fear of being swallowed up by the underworld.
What amazed me more as I watched was the performance of the young African kids in contention. Some of these young black kids were winning their heats.
I got so excited that at one point I was taking so many photos until my four-year-old daughter interjected, saying: “But Daddy, Siya [her sister] is not swimming.”
For a moment I thought triathlon has a bright future after all.
If these kids carry on like this, there is no reason the Bay cannot produce competitive champions of colour in triathlon.
I am well aware that triathlon is more than swimming but the fact is, swimming is the biggest deterrent for young blacks.
The fear of the water has been ingrained in us for decades and working through that will take time.
For the few hours on the sidelines of a primary school swimming gala, I developed hope and belief that the African child is just as capable.
The Bay municipality must be commended for leading the way with its “Learn2Swim” programme – not perfect but a start nonetheless.
A lot more focused effort is needed if Nelson Mandela Bay is to capitalise on its position as the triathlon capital of Africa.
The city is home to many legends such as Raynard Tissink, Kyle Buckingham, Kevin Richards, Alec Riddle, Hanson Singaphi, and many others who have achieved great results in triathlon.
What is needed is a consolidated effort to tap into this wealth of knowledge and experience, then maybe the Bay could produce the first batch of black professional triathletes in the near future.
It is possible.
