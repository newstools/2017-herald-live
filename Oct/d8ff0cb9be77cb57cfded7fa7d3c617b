Emotional day for legal representatives as victims share harrowing tales with court
Seasoned attorneys had trouble containing their emotions during pre-sentencing proceedings of a serial rapist in the Port Elizabeth High Court yesterday.

Judge Mandela Makaula had to adjourn proceedings briefly for the advocates of both the defence and the prosecution to compose themselves when they broke down crying during their arguments in mitigation and aggravation of sentence.
This came shortly after Mzikayise Mkavu, 27, was convicted of 17 counts of rape, eight counts of assault with intent to do grievous bodily harm, five counts of robbery with aggravating circumstances, three counts of attempted robbery, two counts of assault and one count of attempted murder.
He was arrested shortly after his latest offence in January last year and his DNA was positively linked to the other offences before court, the earliest being committed in July 2008.
He pleaded guilty to the charges against him.
Following Mkavu’s conviction, nine of his victims were called to testify in aggravation of his sentence, giving harrowing accounts of how they were assaulted, robbed, stabbed and raped, and how their lives had been irrevocably affected by the incidents.
One of the victims, 26, with a visible scar on her forehead, told the court how she was stabbed in the face, how her eye came loose from its socket and how she held it in her hand while Mkavu proceeded to rape her in June 2012.
Her eye was later surgically replaced in its socket.
Another victim, 29, told of her three suicide attempts after being attacked by Mkavu in February 2014, how she had become obsessive over her child’s safety and how sometimes she could still smell Mkavu’s body odour from the day of the offence.
A victim, 25, lost an eye after Mkavu raped her and stabbed her in the face in December 2012.
She has been the victim of unending teasing due to her facial wounds, and has turned to alcohol, whereas she was once a very religious person.


After her testimony, she asked Mkavu for a response.
Mkavu, who mostly sat with a sweater pulled over his head, stood up with his hands on his head covering the sides of his face and asked the court, packed with friends and family of the victims, for forgiveness.
“I apologise for [what] I have done. I hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me. I have done many things to devastate people on earth, and for that I apologise,” Mkavu said.
His apology was met with murmuring from the gallery.
Defence advocate Jodene Coertzen said there were no witnesses in mitigation of sentence, and also had little to offer in the way of compelling circumstances for the judge to deviate from the prescribed minimum sentence.
At the end of her argument, she broke down crying and said the accused deserved whatever sentence the judge handed down.
In reply, state advocate Ismat Cerfontein also become emotional while addressing the court, and after a short adjournment told the court that these might not be all the offences Mkavu had committed, but only the ones that were reported and linked through his DNA.
“[The accused] was like a vicious predator roaming the streets at night, looking for his next prey,” Cerfontein said.
“How many other cases have gone unsolved due to a lack of evidence?
“If not for the DNA database, his reign of terror would no doubt have continued.”
Makaula is expected to hand down sentence tomorrow.
