 Jennifer Kestis Ferguson claims Danny Jordaan raped her 24 years ago Picture: Facebook
Jennifer Ferguson has formally reached out to SAFA boss Danny Jordaan offering a mediation process following allegations that he raped her in Port Elizabeth in 1993.
Ferguson, who now lives in Sweden, claims Jordaan violently raped her at The Holiday Inn on the Port Elizabeth beachfront after a banquet at which she was singing.
Despite repeated requests for comment Jordaan has not yet made a statement.
The former ANC MP said in a Facebook message on Tuesday morning: “The levels of rape that have been normalised in our society are damaging to the very fabric of sanity in our communities. The levels of silenced pain in our nation cannot continue without serious consequences.
“Men who choose to rape women are seriously damaged. Women who are raped are confronted with death and forced to continue living with the memory of their humiliation being a constant experience. A society that laughs at this pathology is betraying its future.
“We have to find another way.
“We have decided to formally offer Danny Jordaan an opportunity for a mediated restorative justice process that would be facilitated by Paul Verryn in consultation with experts in this field.”
Ferguson took to social media last Wednesday writing a heartrending account of her alleged rape.
Almost 24 years ago, she wrote, a “pleasant and entertaining” Jordaan asked her to join him for a drink after a performance she had given at the hotel.
“I accepted his invitation to join him for a drink at the bar, but said I needed to go up to my suite and change from my performance dress.
“He joined me in the lift and said he would wait for me. I felt a little uneasy as he entered my suite, but I beckoned him into the lounge and asked him to wait there while I changed.”
Ferguson alleges that she entered the bedroom, closed the door and began to change when Jordaan entered and overpowered her.
She wrote: “He overpowered me and painfully raped me.
“It must have been over in about 20 seconds although it felt like a lifetime. He left immediately without saying a word.”
