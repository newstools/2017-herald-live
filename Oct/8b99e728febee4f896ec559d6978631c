This week Just Ella Bella Eleanor Douglas-Meyers delves into her memories of the “terrible twos” – and says the expectation did not match the product.
 
 
Although my son is now four going on forty, I came across this entry I did two years ago when he had just turned two and I thought I would share it with those moms in the throes of the terrible twos. It gets easier I am told!
To whom it may concern.
I am writing to bring to your attention a few aspects of my product which are not at all as advertised.
I know that most warranties expire after two years, so this is by no means an attempt to acquire a replacement. Instead I would just appreciate if you were to revise your advertising campaign.
Firstly, thank you for the item – it is more beautiful than I could ever have imagined. There are a few inconsistencies though.
According to the advertising (which played mostly in my head while pregnant), the item in question should be interested in a variety of foods.
I had every intention of making bento boxes and smoothies (just check my Pinterest feed).
I was under the impression we would chat over milk and biscuits and he would beg to lick the spoon when I bake, but that feature is yet to kick in. In fact, I think you might have shipped me a solar-powered version.
Secondly, our shopping trips are nothing like advertised (again mostly in my head). There is no strolling through the shops in heels as a well-behaved tyke holds my hand and I push a trolley filled with organic goodies.
In fact, just yesterday, I had said tyke half way up the shelves in Clicks (I kid you not), chanting “I like to climb up and up”.
I picked him up (or down in this case) and had him flailing under my arm as he attempted to lick my hand because apparently his tongue tasted funny. This was a step up as reprimanding him is usually met with blowing, spitty raspberries or playing dead.
I put him down and he made a giggly run for it. This glitch comes about at least twice a day and was not advertised. The product is much faster than expected, also way more slippery and much dirtier.
The walking setting seems to have been replaced by running and talking by screaming.
He doesn’t seem to have the built-in “stand there and be quiet” feature either. Surely this is an error? He insists on greeting everyone everywhere we go.
He had a meltdown when someone asking for food at our door, didn’t give him a fist bump (cried for like 15 minutes because the “uncle didn’t say hello”).
Don’t get me started on the “sads” brought on by shopkeepers not engaging in conversation and not accepting his clumsy two-year-old help along the lines of “I fix, I fix”, “Aidy can”, “Aidy help” and more.
Although this product is not at all what I expected, if you try to take it from me, I will chase you down with the speed developed from chasing him around and beat you down with the strong arms acquired from wrestling him down.
Please do consider including instructions for future models.
Yours sincerely, a mom of a two-year-old.
