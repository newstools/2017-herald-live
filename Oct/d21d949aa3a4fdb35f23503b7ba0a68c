Apart from an action-packed racing schedule, fans will also be treated to a fashion show and entertainment at this year’s Algoa Cup at Fairview Race Course tomorrow.
Furthermore, there are many lucky draws and prizes to give away to the public in between the races.
The first race is scheduled to start at 1.05pm.
Event organiser Karin le Roux said the event had drawn a lot of interest and their phones had been ringing non-stop with people calling and wanting to find out more about the day’s proceedings.
“From the event’s perspective, all our planning has been going well. We have a lot of people calling and wanting to know more about the event and telling us that they will be joining us.


“I am hoping for really nice weather on Sunday,” she said.
“At the top venue, the HB Christian Room, we are on 240 people for lunch already. Downstairs, for the general public we are busy putting up our infrastructure and all our kiddies’ activities are coming. Some of the food stalls are coming in today.
“If the weather plays along with us, we are hoping for a really nice crowd.”
Le Roux said there were two time slots for the fashion show. One is set to start after race three at 2.15pm and the second one after race five at 3.25pm.
“Braemore Lundall-Sauls is a local de- signer who will be showcasing his new range called SHIA BLAK at Fairview.
“Sophisticate Models, which was established in 1988 by Gail Brown, cele- brated its 29th anniversary in August and will showcase these gorgeous designs from Braemore Design.


“The dancing displays, which will be done by Psyko Souljazs, will take place after race one at 1.05pm and again after race four at 2.50pm, and Legato A Capella Singers will be performing after race two and again after race six,” she said.
Tomorrow’s race will be very interesting as two previous winners of the Algoa Cup are back to compete.
Last year it was won by Nebula for Cape Town trainer Brett Crawford, and in 2015 Stonehenge took the first prize for Gauteng-based champion Sean Tarry, his first-ever win in Port Elizabeth.
