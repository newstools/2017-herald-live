It is up to students to make arrangements with their landlords when it comes to paying for electricity.
This was the word from Nelson Mandela Bay mayoral spokesman Sibongile Dimbaza in response to comments made by newly elected Nelson Mandela University SRC president Bamanye Matiwane last week.
Matiwane said mayor Athol Trollip had failed students at NMU by prioritising issues regarding small pockets of individuals in the metro above those of education and particularly tertiary education.
Matiwane said this in reference to the fact that students were obligated to buy prepaid electricity while residing in privately owned residences.


He says the metro should be providing a subsidy to students to cover service expenses such as water and electricity.
In response, Dimbaza said: “The municipality currently subsidises thousands of poor households in the metro through the Assistance To The Poor (ATTP) Programme by alleviating the financial burden of paying municipal accounts.
“Therefore, contractual arrangements between students as tenants and their landlords should address this matter as it falls outside of our mandate as the municipality.
“It is therefore misleading of the current SRC incumbent to lay the blame at the mayor’s doorstep.”
