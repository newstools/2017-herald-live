 Six municipal firearms and an unknown sum of money were stolen from the Sundays River Valley Municipality traffic department in Kirkwood in a late-night burglary, which was discovered only yesterday morning.
The burglary was thought to be an inside job, as the culprits appeared to know exactly where to walk to avoid setting off the alarm, insiders said. Police, however, were tight-lipped, saying only they were investigating a burglary and theft.
The department is situated in Middle Street, Kirkwood.
Three weeks ago, seven state firearms were also stolen from the Provincial Traffic Department offices in Grahamstown, in a similar burglary.
DA regional leader Terri Stander said the Kirkwood building had been entered through the roof.
“They broke into an office and from there they got hold of keys,” Stander said.
“A desk was placed up against the security sensor, which led to no movement being detected. How they did this is still being looked into.
“It would appear that the culprits knew exactly where to walk to avoid all the sensors.”
Stander said the cashier’s desk had been opened and the main built-in safe key taken.
“A shotgun, two 9mm pistols, a revolver and two .38 firearms were stolen.
“In addition to the firearms, 1 800 rounds for the 9mm pistols were also taken,” she said.
Stander said it was thought that the thugs had triggered the alarm when leaving.
Police arrived at about 1.10am yesterday after the alarm had been triggered.
With the department in Grahamstown also being burgled, Stander said it was thought that a syndicate could be involved.
The Provincial Traffic Department offices in Grahamstown, in Knight Street, were also set alight.
Six computers and a mainframe server, containing the department’s data and other content like traffic fines, were destroyed in the fire
It was revealed in September that 297 state firearms went missing or had been stolen in the Eastern Cape during the past three years.
“We are concerned about the government-owned firearms that are being stolen,” Stander said.
Police spokeswoman Gerda Swart confirmed an investigation, but declined to give further details.
Sundays River Valley Municipality spokeswoman Vuyiseka Mboxela said: “An audit is being done to see exactly what was stolen.”
