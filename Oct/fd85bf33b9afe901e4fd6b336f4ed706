Rain over parts of the Eastern Cape over the past two days brought little relief from the ongoing drought across the province.
While parts of Port Elizabeth and surrounds measured significant rainfall, the catchment areas feeding into the metro’s supply dams saw little rain, keeping dam levels in the region of a critically low 30% collectively.
According to the Port Elizabeth office of the South African Weather Service, the Friendly City received more than 20mm of rain in places.
Spokesman Garth Sampson said Lorraine and surrounds had recorded the highest rainfall, but showers and clouds had cleared up by noon yesterday.


“Port Elizabeth Airport saw about 21mm of rain, while Lorraine tops the list with 25mm. Low-lying areas around Third Avenue in Newton Park had some localised flooding as water came down the Baakens Valley,” Sampson said.
He said Kareedouw and surrounds, the catchment area for the Churchill and Impofu dams, received between 5mm and 13mm of rain. However, this would have little effect on the dams’ levels, which measured 13.6% and 51.7% respectively on Monday.
Even less significant was rainfall in the Kouga and Uitenhage catchments, seeing less than 1mm of rain.
Nelson Mandela Bay municipal spokesman Kupido Baron said they hoped the rain had brought some relief to the metro and surrounds.
“Despite heavy rainfall in areas, no serious incidents, like major car accidents or serious flooding, were re- ported. We hope to see more rain in the coming days,” Baron said.


The weekend forecast, according to Weather SA, shows no more rain for the remainder of the weekend.
Warm weather is expected along the coast, with temperatures reaching into the high 20s. Temperatures will drop slightly next week, but no rain is expected.
Other parts of the province and the Garden Route also recorded low rainfall figures over the last two days.
Plettenberg Bay measured 11mm, while Mossel Bay and Mthatha recorded 6mm and 3mm respectively. East London saw less than 1mm.
