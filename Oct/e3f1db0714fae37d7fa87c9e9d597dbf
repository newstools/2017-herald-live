Further measures planned as consumption rises, rainfall drops
Further water restrictions are on the cards for Nelson Mandela Bay residents, with the municipality set to release the details next week. This comes after water consumption had steadily increased since May.
Bay engineering and infrastructure head Annette Lovemore said the city had also experienced the lowest levels of rainfall in the past 20 years.
“Without significant rainfall, and runoff into the dams, the supply from our dams will run dry within 12 months,” Lovemore said.
“A statement will be released next week outlining the metro’s infrastructure and operational plans, and announcing further water restrictions.” In July last year, the average dam levels stood at 72.58%, but this has seen a steady decline to 31.29% last month.
Lovemore said the Kouga Dam was down to 13.46% of its capacity.
The dam feeds Nelson Mandela Bay, Kouga Municipality and the Gamtoos valley agricultural sector.
“Not only will communities be without water when this dam falls below its usable level, but economic consequences will be dire,” she said.
“This scenario is mere months away if no major rain event occurs in the respective catchment areas.”
The combined dam levels for the city are at an average of 30.18%.
In May, the city used an average of 258.99 megalitres (ML) a day.
This increased to an average daily consumption of 267.6ML in June, 275.56ML in July, 273.19ML in August, and 281ML last month.
“The upward trend in water usage must be reversed, with urgency.


“Recent positive events could have given consumers the perception that the water disaster situation has changed.”
Lovemore said they suspected this was linked to the commissioning of phase two of the Nooitgedacht scheme and recent rainfall.
“Even though [the city] has increased the capacity of the Nooitgedacht system, this does not improve the water scarcity situation.
“This additional capacity came at a vital time, only filling the void created by the Churchill Dam being virtually empty [and water abstraction from it being halted].
“We experienced good rain in the Loerie Dam catchment which caused excitement for many.
“However, the Loerie Dam is a small balancing dam. Even when it is full, it does not have the storage capacity to outlast the greater crisis.
“Its capacity is about 2% of that of the Kouga Dam.”
She said there were more than 1 500 households using more than 40 kilolitres of water a month.
“The supply to these customers is being individually restricted. We need every household to revert, at the very least, to its water-saving habits of May this year.
“Ideally even more water should be saved than was the case in May,” she said.
