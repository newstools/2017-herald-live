The creative community of Nelson Mandela Bay are picking up their paintbrushes ahead of this year’s Art Meander, which starts tomorrow afternoon and runs until Sunday afternoon.

Amateur artist Cindy Oberholzer founded the Art Meander five years ago to inspire the general public with an inside look at the artistic process.
Each year, she has seen the event grow and this weekend will be the largest in terms of the number of artists and studios on show, featuring oil and watercolour artists, potters and woodturners.
Art lovers are asked to pop in to one of three venues to buy an Art Meander map listing artists and studios which will be open for visitors this weekend.
The Art Meander starts at 1pm tomorrow and will continue on Saturday and Sunday from 9am. The studios will close at 4pm each day.
This year, there is also a demonstration programme with 20 workshops, mostly of one hour each.
As many art galleries are normally closed on weekends, the meander will give a brief and unique view into the art world.


The maps are on sale at three venues, and may only be bought on the days of the meander:

Art on Target, 2 Target Kloof, Essexvale; Bretten-Anne, 083-728-5295;
Angel Wings Ceramics Studio, on the corner of Alabaster Street and Lower Valley Road in the Baakens Valley; Monique, 082-893-0012;
Periwinkle Studio, 114 Marine Drive, Schoenmakerskop; Talbot, 082-4969-622.

In addition to these three “hubs” however, there are several art studios to visit, including Nelson Mandela University’s art gallery in Bird Street.
During the Art Meander, the gallery will exhibit highlights from third and fourth year students enrolled in their Fine Art, Design and Photography programmes, and there will be a few postgraduate students on hand to discuss the work.
