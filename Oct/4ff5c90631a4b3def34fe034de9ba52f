The plastic heart valve made in South Africa
A cheap, mass-produced plastic heart valve‚ invented and made in Cape Town‚ is set to save the lives of millions of people, many of them young.
After eight years of research‚ 150 rheumatic heart disease patients will have it inserted next year in a clinical trial.
Instead of open heart surgery, requiring expensive machines and specialist hospitals and surgeons‚ the valve can be inserted at a rural hospital by a general surgeon through a small incision.
Peter Zilla, head of the Christiaan Barnard Cardiothoracic Surgery department at the University of Cape Town‚ led the team that developed the valve and the insertion technique.
“A self-homing hollow balloon carries the valve into the heart‚” Zilla said.
“The heart continues to beat during the implantation of the valve without interrupting the blood flow to the brain and the other organs.”
News of the breakthrough‚ which brings hope of cheap lifesaving surgery to 33 million people worldwide with rheumatic heart disease‚ comes shortly before the 50th anniversary on December 3 of the world’s first heart transplant – in 1967, by Professor Christiaan Barnard in Cape Town.


The company that makes the valves‚ UCT start-up Strait Access Technologies‚ won two global awards for the technology at the European Association of Cardio-Thoracic Surgery annual congress in Austria earlier this month.
Strait chief operating officer Heather Coombes said: “It was amazing to see the enthusiasm with which this innovation was welcomed by so many of the world’s top cardiac surgeons and academics.”
UCT medical school head Professor Bongani Mayosi said rheumatic heart disease occurred most frequently among 14- to 30 year olds with limited access to health care.
“An initial untreated throat infection with streptococcal bacteria leads to an immune response of the body that inadvertently also attacks a patient’s heart valves‚” he said.
“Only an artificial valve could save patients’ lives.”
Zilla said talks were under way with international bodies like the UN Industrial Development Organisation‚ and NGOs and African hospitals‚ about the rollout of the valve once the clinical trial and regulatory approvals were complete.
The UCT team is also using its experience in tissue regeneration to create living replacement heart valves that can grow with the patient.
