 President Joe Orsmond, left, convenor Mary Birt and Donald Hendry, the only surviving founding member, are planning the Grahamstown Wine Tasting Circle’s 40th birthday.
The Grahamstown Wine Tasting Circle, a strong contender for the oldest continuously active wine tasting club in South Africa, will celebrate its 40th birthday with a weekend of special events on Friday and next Saturday November 3 and 4.
Started in 1977, the circle has met faithfully, 10 months a year, over the past four decades.
Guests will be flying in from around the country to share in the celebration.
The group also boasts some notable alumni. Stony Brook winemaker Nigel McNaught is a former GWTC president. He, Joy McNaught and 10 other former members make up the Western Cape “chapter” of the circle.
Other former “Circlers” include Graeme “Curly” Reed, former winemaker at Hillcrest, and Meryl Weaver and Dave Swingler, who both taste for the Platter’s Wine Guide.
Many members who have been there from the early days. One – Donald Hendry – has been involved since the inaugural tasting and was the first president.
“It’s not easy to keep a group like this going over such a long time,” current president Joe Orsmond said. “It’s a tribute to the dedication and passion of all our members – past and present – that we are celebrating this milestone.”
The circle has 10 tastings a year and has kept meticulous records of each one. It also has an annual special tasting to sample unusual, particularly excellent or rare wines. According to Orsmond, even though there are very few wine producers in the area and no specialist wine shops, circle members still found interesting themes for tastings through careful research.
“The society was formed round a very focused interest in wine. We share an endless curiosity about it and a real desire to understand and appreciate it. It’s this common interest that has kept us going for so long,” he said.
The guest wines at Friday night’s special tasting will be from Rustenburg Estate courtesy of winemakers Murray and Tammy Barlow who, as Rhodes University alumni, are also former Grahamstown residents. Murray won the prestigious Diner’s Club Young Winemaker of the Year award for a second time last year.
There will also be a dinner next Saturday, with more than 16 producers donating top-quality bottles for the event.
“It will be a wonderful opportunity to reminisce and drink some superb wine,” Orsmond said. “Plus, it’s not just about celebrating the last 40 years. It’s about looking forward to the next.”
