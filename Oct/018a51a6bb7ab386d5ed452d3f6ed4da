Dear Makhosi Khoza,
Thank you for your stand against corruption.
I like the way you stand up for what is believable and challenge the incredible. Many people are very grateful that you didn’t buckle under the dishonest, manipulative, opportunist and bullying ANC onslaught.
There are others in the ANC who would like to be brave like you, but either haven’t got the courage, or need the ANC income. (The goose which lays the golden eggs).
What a pity that fear, empty yet hopeful promises and money keep these people shackled to that immorally-led party.
You’re a brave woman and obviously well principled, and you’ve made the right move, to get out while you are not indelibly painted into their picture of eternal shame.
If you’re deciding which party to join, or whether to start your own party, that question should be easily answered.
New parties need huge backing and even good people can fail – and expire – quickly. They, too often, get lost before they can make desperately needed change.
And they usually only get one chance to succeed, in the torrent of ANC propaganda.
I’m not in favour of the red brigade of the EFF, because it’s too full of empty emotion and stimulated anger. I’m glad when they make their point, but they’re not sustainable in the long term. Bantu Holomisa is a great guy. I like him very much, and I was part of discussions with him and Roelf Meyer when they first began.
I wasn’t going to join the party, but I helped introduce them when they opened their campaign in Port Elizabeth in the Hellenic Hall.
Unfortunately there are too few Bantus and Roelfs, to gain traction.


But it was a great idea and I hope that they win some of the fallout of ANC escapees.
One of the points I made in introducing Holomisa and Meyer was that it was a very good start, that a white man and a black man – both willing to put the past behind them, with credible political CVs and seeking equality for all – had joined hands to take the multicoloured, multi-language, multicultured South Africa forward.
COPE hasn’t made the impact that we expected and might have been formed in anger against the treatment of Thabo Mbeki, who was so much a better president in many ways than Jacob Zuma.
He made a bad mistake regarding Dr Beetroot [Manto Tshabala-Msimang], but was at least acceptable as a world player.
The ACDP has a high standard of moral application, but is a lightweight fighter with limited potential. The only player strong enough to partner with you is the DA, and it needs a brave mover and shaker like you.
You should join it at the top of its management pyramid.
Many times it shouts all the right things, but it battles to get ordinary, superstitious, fearful black people to understand and believe.
You would appeal to South African top management as well as the South African grassroots public, and you would make a huge difference in the party, to the benefit of South Africa.
And no matter what people say about the DA, no matter how it is maligned, it certainly produces the goods in all areas it gains support.
In those places where it has gained support, it has to first sort out decades of ANC corruption and inefficiency, fixing that which was mucked up.
It’s my personal opinion that you’re needed by all South Africans, to speed up change in South Africa and you could probably do it best within the DA.
God bless you for the stance you took against dishonest government, even when you received threats on your life. And may he protect and guide you.
