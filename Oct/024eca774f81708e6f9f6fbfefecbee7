In his 14 years as a detective Sergeant Sizwe Gaika rates the recent conviction of a serial rapist as one of the sweetest victories of his career, writes Riaan Marais
Clinical investigations coupled with the police’s indispensable DNA profile database were the foundation that led to the sentencing of convicted serial rapist Mzikayise Mkavu, 27, and securing 13 life sentences and an additional 228 years behind bars.

During sentencing in the Port Elizabeth High Court on Thursday, Judge Mandela Makaula branded Mkavu as a “heartless predator” for raping 17 women in KwaNobuhle between 2008 and last year, leaving some scarred, mutilated and partially blind.
Relieved investigating officer Sergeant Sizwe Gaika, 45, said Mkavu’s case was the worst he had dealt with.
“The violent nature of these offences, and the number of times the perpetrator was able to commit the same offence before being apprehended, is what sets this apart as the worst case I have ever dealt with,” Gaika said.
“What scares me is that we have no way of knowing exactly how many women he really attacked. These 17 cases are just the ones that were reported to the police.”
The tall, bespectacled man, originally from Keiskammahoek, joined the police 15 years ago, and became a detective a year later.
He now operates out of the Eastern Cape police headquarters in Zwelitsha, and is attached to the family violence, child protection and sexual offences unit (FCS), forming part of their specialist serial and electronic criminal investigation (SECI) team.
He became involved with this investigation shortly after Mkavu’s DNA sample raised some red flags on the national DNA database.

Mkavu was arrested shortly after he robbed and raped a 31-year-old woman, but was released due to a lack of evidence. Luckily a DNA sample was taken and alarm bells rang when the sample was put into the central DNA database.
“I received a report from the database management team stating that there was a possible link between Mkavu’s DNA sample and 17 reported rape cases stretching over more than seven years. But before an arrest could be made I had to obtain a second sample from him and run it through the database again to confirm his involvement without a doubt.


“The amount of possible links to this guy was overwhelming. This became my priority. I knew I had to find this guy and stop him,” Gaika said.
He remembers how “cool” Mkavu was when he tracked him down and asked for a DNA sample.
“He cooperated without hesitation. But I know from experience that serial offenders are often very cool, very calm. They never give anything away.”
The sample was sent to Cape Town for testing, but Gaika did not wait around for the results.
He started tracking down the victims and obtained statements about their incidents.
If the sample confirmed Mkavu was the rapist, he wanted him locked up as soon as possible.
“The test results came back in April 2016, confirming Mkavu was the guy. I immediately went to arrest him. I knew he had to be stopped.”
To his shock and surprise January 2016 was not the end of Mkavu’s violent spree.
“I presented all the evidence, including the DNA tests, to Mkavu. While interrogating him I asked Mkavu when the last time was that he raped someone. He told me it was on his birthday in March.
“That case was never reported. This made me wonder how many other cases went unreported. How many women did this sick man rape?”
Gaika said Mkavu’s “blitz tactics” of overwhelming his victims with a violent attack before raping them made this one of his most horrendous cases.
“He fed off his victims’ pain. He could not be aroused unless he made them bleed first. The more violent the attack, the more pleasure he got from it,” Gaika said.
After the sentence was handed down, some of the victims lined up to hug the big man, thanking him for bringing their attacker to justice.
After everyone left the courtroom he stayed behind, sitting in the gallery by himself.
He was making notes for a report about the sentence, but when he looked up there were tears in his eyes.
“This is a good sentence,” he said.
He thanked the victims for coming forward and reliving their horrific experiences during his investigation and during their testimony in court, and implored all detectives to do rocksolid investigations before taking cases to court.
He also called on the public to come forward if they were victims of any crime.
“This case proves all crimes need to be reported. Somewhere a link will be made and offenders will be brought to justice.”
