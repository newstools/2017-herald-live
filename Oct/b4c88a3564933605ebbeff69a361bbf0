Auditor-general asked to either take over probe into Bobani or appoint replacement for PwC
UDM president Bantu Holomisa has asked the auditor-general to intervene in an ongoing investigation by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC).
The call came after the auditing firm had sent questions to former Nelson Mandela Bay deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani.
In a letter to auditor-general Thembekile Makwetu, Holomisa said PwC had been compromised and was unable to undertake a confidential quality forensic investigation.
Holomisa asked Makwetu on Tuesday to either take over the investigation or appoint an independent firm.
Makwetu said yesterday the request would be assessed and he would respond to Holomisa in due time.
PwC is investigating the alleged irregular appointment of litter pickers at various depots in the metro, alongside alleged irregular payments made to environmental consulting company Milongani Eco Consulting.
The PwC investigation will cost nearly R1-million.
“The UDM finds it astonishing that the PwC ‘draft report’ dated August 21 somehow landed in the briefcase of a national leader of a political party,” Holomisa wrote, referring to national DA leader Mmusi Maimane.
“While the investigation was commissioned by the [Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality], the DA has to date not explained why this was the case.”
Holomisa questioned further how Maimane had been privy to information related to the draft report 21 days before it was issued.
“By its own admission, PwC had conducted ‘field work’ up to August 18 – and if we assume the city manager Johann Mettler gave an instruction for the investigation in May, how did Maimane come out, 21 days before the ‘draft report’ was issued, saying there was prima facie evidence that Bobani was corrupt?” he wrote.
Maimane’s spokeswoman, Portia Adams, said he could not comment on a letter he had not seen.
“Our stance on Bobani’s behaviour has not changed,” Adams said.
Holomisa also outlined in the letter what he would have Makwetu look into, including what constituted “field work” and also what costs had already been incurred.


Holomisa also questioned how PwC had been commissioned, without a council resolution.
“It begs the question, how was PwC appointed?” he said in the letter.
“Were internal audit processes even utilised or is it a fait accompli that PwC is a ‘preferred service provider’ of the DA’s and therefore council’s.
“We also ask that your office investigate this matter and also verify the regularity of this government expenditure.”
However, Mettler said yesterday that Makwetu had no authority to take over the investigation or appoint another firm.
“This is a municipal matter,” Mettler said.
“The auditor-general has an obligation to audit that which we have done, he does not have the authority to initiate an investigation.
“He would normally advise a municipality to investigate when he comes across something.”
Mettler said whichever audit firm the city chose to conduct the investigation was the municipality’s prerogative.
But Holomisa said yesterday he was confident the auditor-general had the powers to investigate.
PwC chief operating officer Fulvio Tonelli said the company was aware of the letter.
“We will cooperate with the auditor-general in its process and also provide information that may be required,” Tonelli said.
“While we cannot comment on the allegations at this stage, we confirm our view that PwC has conducted this investigation in a fair and balanced manner and that we have faith in the quality of our work.”
