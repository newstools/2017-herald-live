Claim issue swept under carpet, writes Siyamtanda Capa




An internal investigation has been launched by the Nelson Mandela Bay municipality into a fatal accident involving a security officer assigned to DA Eastern Cape leader Nqaba Bhanga.
Close protection officer Kgothatso Moshele – who was on his way to collect Bhanga’s girlfriend – was critically injured in the crash in which two people died.
The accident happened at the Spondo Street and Uitenhage Road intersection in Zwide in the early hours of Sunday morning.
Police spokeswoman Captain Sandra Janse van Rensburg said a 17-year-old male had been declared dead on the scene and a 45-year-old woman had died in hospital.
Their identities have not yet been released.
A case of culpable homicide has been opened with Algoa Park police.
Bhanga said earlier Moshele had been hit by a jikeleza taxi.
He had been on his way to fetch Bhanga’s girlfriend because Bhanga was entertaining guests from Cape Town.


Moshele is still in hospital.
However, yesterday Bhanga referred all questions to the safety and security department.
Safety and security political head John Best said he was not clear on the rules regarding close protection officers.
“I have only seen a preliminary report and [Moshele] was travelling alone in the car along the Uitenhage Road. It looks like the other vehicle jumped a light and the two people in the car were killed.
“I do not know the rules regarding close protection officers,” Best said.
City manager Johann Mettler said the internal investigation would be concluded on Monday.
“Our investigation will focus on what happened. We will be looking at compliance with internal procedures and see if there was any negligence as well as damage to municipal assets.
“Our investigation will get to the facts first and if prima facie evidence of wrongdoing is shown, the appropriate processes will follow,” Mettler said.
While council speaker Jonathan Lawack said he could not speculate on what had happened, protection officers were required to drive their principals whenever needed.




“The welfare policy makes provision that in a case where there is a threat on a councillor’s life, security measures are put in place to safeguard the life of such councillors,” Lawack said.
However, opposition parties in the Bay have claimed the incident was swept under the carpet.
ANC Bay secretary Themba Xathula said the party would write a letter to mayor Athol Trollip requesting a full explanation.
“It is extremely disturbing that a municipality like Nelson Mandela Bay and its political leadership – that includes Trollip and Lawack – could allow this serious issue to be swept under the carpet,” Xathula said.


UDM councillor and former deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani said: “What we want to know is why this was swept under the carpet. It is embarrassing that a municipal vehicle is driving around in the early hours of the morning.
“What we want at this point is for Bhanga to be fired and for Trollip to resign because it is clear they cannot run this city.”
EFF leader Zilindile Vena said they had been shocked to hear of the accident.
“We wish to send our condolences … and we wish those in hospital a speedy recovery.
“We are shocked to learn that he [Moshele] was on duty in the early hours of Sunday, especially after we were recently talking about how close protection officers are not paid for overtime exceeding 60 hours a month,” Vena said.
