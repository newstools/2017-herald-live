Decisions allegedly made at secret meetings
A former ANC insider has made startling claims about how party boss Zandisile Qupe allegedly doled out lucrative contracts for Nelson Mandela Bay’s Integrated Public Transport System (IPTS). The allegation is contained in a book by Crispian “Chippy” Olver, How to Steal a City, The Battle for Nelson Mandela Bay.
It claims the Bay ANC regional boss was part of a series of secret meetings at which dubious contracts relating to the bus system were allegedly decided.
While Qupe denied the allegations, he admitted he had met some of those involved with the bus system before, but said this was in relation to their ANC involvement and not the IPTS.
Olver headed then cooperative governance minister Pravin Gordhan’s national government intervention into the municipality’s administration.
At the book launch in Port Elizabeth on Monday, Olver said it was written from municipal documents and forensic and audit reports as well as recorded interviews he had conducted.
According to the book, Qupe, an ANC regional secretary at the time of the alleged meetings, was incriminated by Port Elizabeth lawyer David le Roux.
Under interrogation by Olver at the City Hall in September 2015, Le Roux, whose firm Le Roux Inc benefited from bus contracts, is said to have spilt the beans on the dealings of the powerful network accused of siphoning millions from the IPTS.
In the book, Olver said investigations had shown that then ANC deputy regional chairman Tony Duba’s company, Distictive Trading, had scored about R35.1-million from IPTS contracts.
While records showed Distictive Trading was paid millions to market a non-functional IPTS, Duba is not actually listed as the company owner.
According to Olver’s book, three sources had confirmed to him that former IPTS director Mhleli Tshamase often met with Port Elizabeth businessman Fareed Fakir and Qupe – sometimes with Le Roux present.
“Decisions about how to divide the IPTS pie, and which consultants and companies to give work to, were made during these meetings,” Olver wrote.
“By analysing the municipality’s e-mail records, [municipal auditing official] Werner Wiehart had discovered that most of Tshamase’s memos, as official proposals for expenditure are known, were actually written by David le Roux – something that Le Roux himself confirmed when I interviewed him,” Olver wrote. He said this meant the IPTS was essentially managed from outside the municipal administration, and was indirectly controlled by Fakir.
Asked for his side of the story yesterday, Qupe laughed off allegations he had met with people to discuss the IPTS.
“As an ANC secretary, how can I know who to give contracts to? I was not working in the municipality,” he said.
“It cannot be possible that I would sit in on a meeting to say ‘here are consulting companies and you must give so much to this company and so much to that company’.”
He said anything related to how the municipality was run by the administration was out of his control.
“If the ANC wanted to deal with the administration through issues brought by deployees, we had the office of the chief whip who had a role of being the link between the ANC and the municipality,” Qupe said.
Asked if he had benefited directly or indirectly from IPTS contracts, he said: “I have not been part of any IPTS projects.”
But he confirmed that he had met Le Roux, Tshamase and Fakir.
“As the then-ANC regional secretary, I met with various people during my time in that position.
“There were many people who supported the ANC during our time in office.


“But this remains the information of the ANC. I am not obliged to indicate who and how someone was supporting the ANC.”
He said while they were busy with last year’s local government elections, the ANC had a structure called the Young Professionals and Businesspeople. Part of the programme was gala dinners which Qupe addressed.
“In the programme of the organisation, we met comrade Fareed.
“He was part of the people who had been visible and supported the ANC programmes.”
Qupe said he knew Le Roux and Tshamase, who were part of various ANC programmes.
In the book, Olver said Le Roux was able to clear up the picture of a complex and highly organised syndicate that had managed to capture the municipality during a meeting.
The Herald had previously reported on how Le Roux Inc had benefited to the tune of millions of rands from a number of contracts linked to the municipality’s failed bus system.
It provided legal consulting work for the city and charged a 10% fee for processing invoices billed to the city for IPTS work.
The Hawks swooped on Le Roux Inc in July, when documents and information about the IPTS were handed over. “[Le Roux] also detailed payments to a number of local ANC politicians, and described Fareed Fakir’s role,” Olver wrote.
“After we hammered out a deal with his lawyers, Le Roux provided a full written statement implicating several metro staff involved in the IPTS.
“His evidence confirmed a lot of what we had already established . . . but it helped us understand how the whole system operated.”
Le Roux’s attorney, Lunen Meyer, said yesterday his client declined to comment at this stage.
Tshamase and Fakir could not be reached for comment.
Asked to comment about his name being linked to Distictive Trading in the book, Duba said: “I am not the owner of Distictive Trading and I was not contracted by the city.
“The prudent thing to do is to speak to the owners of Distictive Trading.”
He said Olver should have found out the real owners of Distictive Trading.
“Any work that is published incomplete is just dirty,” Duba said.
“The intention is clearly to tarnish people’s names.”
However, he saw nothing wrong with doing business with the municipality if one was not employed by that government structure.
Distictive Trading owners Mawethu Magida and Zanele Mbatyoti could not be reached for comment.
The book also states that Olver and Qupe met at a guesthouse in Summerstrand owned by Port Elizabeth property mogul Yusuf Jeeva on May 13 last year.
Olver wrote that the meeting was arranged to discuss how the two camps that either supported Qupe or former mayor Danny Jordaan to run the city after the local government elections could set aside their differences. Qupe confirmed the meeting. “I told Chippy at the meeting that if the ANC chooses to support Danny for mayor I would not have a problem as I would not be supporting Danny as a person but as the organisation.”
