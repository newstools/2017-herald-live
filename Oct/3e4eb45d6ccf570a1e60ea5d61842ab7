Grey High will host the Gelvandale Cricket Hub in a much-anticipated 30 over U15 Momentum Friendship match on the Pollock field on Saturday.
The Gelvandale Hub, which consists of eight primary schools and five high schools from the community, will be looking to put up a brave performance against Grey High, who beat them in a T20 game last year.
“We look forward to hosting the Gelvandale Hub,” Grey High sport administrator Neil Bielby said.
“This is a wonderful opportunity for the young cricketers to interact and share skills and ideas.”
Gelvandale Hub president Gary Dolley explained the importance of giving children with potential a chance to showcase their talent.
“This is a great opportunity for these children to display their talent and play against a side like Grey High, who have been performing well against other schools,” Dolley said.
“For us, it is not really about winning but giving these children an opportunity to showcase their talent on the pitch, regardless of what school they come from.
“The children also get to see what career opportunities there are within the sporting environment.”
In an attempt to develop cricket in underprivileged areas, Cricket South Africa set up development hubs and regional performance centres (RPC) by getting them to play against traditional cricket schools earlier this year.


CSA’s Hubs coordinator David Mokopanele said: “The camaraderie between the schools has been great. The traditional schools are keen to be part of this and contribute positively towards the development of the game of cricket in previously disadvantaged areas.”
Momentum head of sponsorship Carel Bosman said the emphasis was less on the results than on the impact of the occasion going forward.
“We are passionate about communities, about people being active and about families,” he said.
“There is a bigger picture for us where we can be involved with cricket from a development level, into club cricket, domestic cricket and international cricket,” he said.
The match is scheduled to start at 11am.
