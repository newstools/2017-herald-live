 Jazz singer Titi Luzipo rocked a Mal’stones design while performing soothing sounds at her show ‘Being Woman’ held at the Athenaeum last Saturday night. Picture: Londeka Dlamini
Is it winter or is it spring, guys, because I am so confused. The worst part is that I don’t know how to dress because I had already started packing my winter clothes away.
Anyway, we are not here to talk about the weather but rather to soak up all the juicy details that only your VIP gossip gal can dish out.

Last Saturday I was surrounded by beauties at musician Titi Luzipo’s Being Woman show. She might not have filled up The Dome but she certainly filled up the Athenaeum in Central.
Since the show started an hour later than it was supposed to, patrons more than indulged on the welcome drinks provided.
By the time the show finally started even I had forgotten my earlier annoyance.
Luzipo dominated with her powerful voice and kicked off the show with a moving worship song.
I’ve always heard people say Luzipo can sing and after seeing her live I agree with them 100%. She brings some stunning jazzy vibes and knows how to get down and shake what her mama have her.
Vintage Cabin owner and surely one of the most stylish chicks in the Bay, Hombakazi Mbu, was in the crowd alongside Malstones designer Asanda Mali and the likes of Bongi Siwisa.
On the other side of the Bay, in KwaNobuhle, people were grooving to some Gqom music at Kwano’s Meat Corner. Spotted in the crowd was ANC member and DA critic Luyolo Nqakula, who was in much happier spirits than his usual disposition.


Nqakula, who was hanging out with pals, was dancing to the sounds of Destruction Boyz who are in PE today for the NMU Campus Shutdown event taking place later on.
Bay creative Xolisa Ngubelanga’s play Flamebook opened at the PE Opera House on Wednesday night.
Though it was not very well attended for an award-winning play, one can only assume and hope that people will show face tonight and tomorrow seeing it’s the weekend.
Skinnerbek would advise them to take the time to personally witness the guy’s impressive storytelling skills. Flamebook is most definitely a refreshing eye-opener to the different perspectives from which we can look at the #FeesMustFall movement.
Sometimes (like all cool people) I’m on Twitter and I follow what is trending. Skinners believes cyber-bullying is a “thing” and it is just not right.
For instance, I think Twitter peeps took it a bit too far when they began attacking former Metro FM radio host Azania.
Some called her names and tagged her in things no mother wants to see.
Let us be kind to each other and not stoop to such despicable forms of bullying.

Until next time darlings, ciao!
