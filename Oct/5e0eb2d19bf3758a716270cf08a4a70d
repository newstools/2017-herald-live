DA member linked to life policy scam, ANC’s Nombiba in pocketing cash claim

Two Nelson Mandela Bay councillors – one from the DA and another from the ANC – appeared on separate fraud charges in the Port Elizabeth Commercial Crimes Court yesterday.
DA councillor Mbulelo Victor Manyati is accused of colluding with his son, as well as Port Elizabeth doctor Lucky Swartbooi, to claim a life insurance policy taken out on someone after he had already died.
Meanwhile, ANC ward 20 councillor Bongo Nombiba is accused of pocketing money meant for a non-government community project.
The case against Nombiba was postponed to November 23 due to his attorney being ill yesterday.
Manyati, who serves on the transport committee, is set to go to trial on May 9.
An undertaker at Zincedeni Funeral Services at the time, Manyati will stand trial alongside Sakhumzi Bazi, Phumelela Radu, Swartbooi and his son, Mandisa Sibham.
According to the prosecution, Bazi could not be traced.
According to the charge sheet, on June 12 2013 Bazi took out a funeral policy called the “Future Builder Family Funeral Plan”, which was underwritten by Metropolitan Life Limited.
In the policy, he covered three individuals who he alleged were his aunt, uncle and cousin.
However, according to the state, Bazi was not related to any of the individuals and the man he claimed was his uncle, Phindiwe Mzwelitye, had already died in October the previous year.
On January 28 2014, and acting in common purpose with Manyati, Radu, Swartbooi and Sibham, Bazi allegedly submitted a death claim for Mzwelitye.
An allegedly false abridged death certificate accompanied the application, stating that Mzwelitye had died on January 20 2014 – two years after his actual death.
Two thumbprints, purporting to be those of the deceased, were placed on the certificate.
It was later discovered that the prints in fact belonged to Sibham.
Swartbooi, who had a previous fraud conviction at the time, claimed that he had examined the body of Mzwelitye on January 1 2014.
Manyati claimed to have collected the body on January 20, with the burial scheduled to take place a couple of days later.
“The fraudulent conduct of the accused persons caused potential prejudice of R30 000 to Metropolitan,” the charge sheet reads.
Swartbooi is no stranger to the law. In 2008, he pleaded guilty to conducting medical examinations for social grant applicants in return for cash while off duty.
Swartbooi, who was charged with fraud, had been accused of taking more than R13 000 in fees for after-hours consultations relating to social grant applications.
He admitted to conducting 131 illegal examinations at a rate of R100 each.
The Social Development Department required social grant applicants to be examined by a state medical officer or district surgeon, which Swartbooi was officially registered to do.
However, he was doing the examinations after hours for cash.
Swartbooi said he knew he was required legally to conduct the examinations within the confines of a state hospital while on duty, and not in a private capacity as he had done.


Magistrate Peter Campbell sentenced Swartbooi to 18 months in prison, suspended for five years, and a fine of R10 000 (or 10 days’ imprisonment).
It is believed Swartbooi paid the fine.
Meanwhile, Nombiba, who appeared in court for the first time last year, stands accused of pocketing the bulk of the money – a total of R20 000 – meant for non-government organisation the Thulamangwane Community Project. The organisation cares for the elderly and cleans underprivileged schools.
He faces charges of fraud and corruption.
It is alleged that in September 2014, Thulamangwane secretary Zukiswa Mbhem and deputy chairman Mandisa Monco approached Nombiba for a donation of R10 000 from the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality.
Nombiba allegedly asked them to put their request in writing, but not to stipulate the exact amount needed.
He then brought the request to then municipality’s chief whip, Joy Seale, motivating a donation of R30 000 from the Ward 20 discretionary fund.
The charge sheet states that on November 4 2014, an amount of R30 000 was paid into Thulamangwane’s bank account.
A couple of days later, Nombiba allegedly informed managerial members of the NGO that only R10 000 was meant for Thulamangwane and that the remaining R20 000 belonged to him.
The money was allegedly paid over to him in two instalments.
ANC Nelson Mandela Bay caucus leader Bicks Ndoni said: “The matter with regard to Nombiba has been discussed by the ANC’s Regional Executive Committee. We will monitor the case and make a decision on a way forward once judgment has been delivered. We respect the court’s decision.”
DA provincial spokesman Mlindi Nhanha said the party had become aware of the charges against Manyati only recently.
“Our information is that this incident occurred in 2015, prior to him joining the DA.
“The Constitution of the Republic affords an accused person to be presumed innocent until the courts prove otherwise.
“The DA would like to appeal for calm and allow the courts to make a determination. We will, however, continue to closely monitor this case until it is finalised. We would like to re-emphasise our commitment to fighting corruption.”
