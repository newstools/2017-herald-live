 There are many aspects to consider when choosing a weeding venue
Picking the right venue for your wedding is key to the success of your special day but it is not always easy.
Securing the perfect wedding venue can feel daunting as there are so many options to choose from.
The first thing you need to consider when booking a venue is of course availability.
Many venues nowadays have online calendars which you can look at when you want to make a booking, but before you do that you need to ask what the deposit is, when it is due, if it is refundable and if there are any discounts being offered on the venue booking. Everything will fall into place once you have found the perfect venue.
Rustig manager Sune Oosthuizen Steenkamp, shares his top tips for picking the perfect venue for your wedding.
1. Always stay true to yourself because your authenticity and vision is very important for your wedding day:
Does the co-ordinator get you? The venue you go with should make it easy to make the vision that you have for your wedding – a reality.
You will also need to check if the venue is naturally beautiful or if it requires additional decor to make it fit the look you’re going for.
Picking a venue that enhances and goes well with the theme you have in mind will help create your dream wedding and will save costs as you won’t need excessive decor.
2. Consider the full guest experience:
Picking a venue that is the right size for your guests is also important. You need to pay attention to the capacity of any venue you’re viewing before you even look at it. There is no point in falling in love with a venue only to discover that it doesn’t have the capacity you need.
If you’re having your reception and wedding ceremony at the same venue – is there enough space for both of the events?
You need to check if the venue you pick provides accommodation. Some of your guests might be travelling from far and may like the option of staying overnight.
Adequate parking for your guests is another factor.
Another important thing to consider when it comes to guests is if the venue is handicap accessible for guests with mobility issues.
You should also check if there is any signage that will direct your guests to the wedding hall, reception area, as well at the restrooms.
A wedding is not just a celebration of a union between two people but a time to make sure that your guests have the best experience – from arrival to departure.
Making sure that you cater to their every need will make them remember your special day.
3. Know what the full venue offering is
While some venues will provide tables and chairs in with the venue hire for example – there may be extra costs involved when it comes to items such as cutlery, table cloths, decorations, plates, glasses, as well as the dance floor.
Other venues might have catering restrictions – meaning that they will want you to use their catering services.
If the idea of finding the perfect venue, rental company and caterer stresses you out, then you might want to go with a full service option.
Not all venues will provide these but you need to make sure that you ask what is included in the booking fee and what you need to source yourself.
When it comes to outdoor weddings – be sure to ask if there are any facilities provided in the quoted venue rate in case it gets too hot or starts raining.
Also find out if the venue provides alcohol as some venues don’t allow you to bring your own alcohol. Permits are normally required and without one – you won’t be able to serve alcohol at your wedding.
In cases where you need to bring your own alcohol, some venues will require you to source your own permit.
Ask about the wedding liability insurance as some venues will ask you to have this in case of any alcohol-related accidents, injuries or any damage to the property.
Another thing to consider is a cancellation fee in case of unpredicted illness.
Find out if the venue has rooms that can be used in the event of bad weather conditions or if you need to organise a marquee for yourself.
The last thing you need is a surprise bill after your wedding day. You need to know that the venue you choose buys into your vision and is willing to go beyond their call of duty to make your dream wedding a reality.
Make sure that you pay attention to the venue as a whole. Look at everything – even the kitchen area, lighting, restrooms and the foyer, to see if everything is up to scratch.
