Plan for national park at Thyspunt, writes Guy Rogers
With nuclear out the way for Thyspunt, opposition groups are throwing their weight behind an alternative project that would celebrate the area’s status as a “coastal cradle of humankind” and create an estimated 1 000 long-term jobs.

The buy-in of Eskom as landowner would be key, but if this can be achieved, proponents say a new national park could be established linking 4 000ha at Thyspunt to the Stone Age archaeological dig at Klasies River, 35km to the west, in a development of global significance.
The park would highlight the birth of modern humans in the area 200 000 years ago and underscore the extraordinarily rich biodiversity that triggered their development.
The proposed development has the backing of the Thyspunt Alliance, the Gamtkwa Khoisan Council and NoPENuke – the three main groups which opposed the nuclear plant at Thyspunt, between Cape St Francis and Oyster Bay.
Trudi Malan, of the Thyspunt Alliance, said the aim was to underscore the human heritage and environmental wealth of the area through low-impact tourism that involved the local community.


“We want to cater for overseas visitors and locals. So we envisage an exclusive lodge on the one hand and, on the other, several rest camps, tented camps and camping sites.”
The aim would be to attract companies looking for unusual breakaway venues and also to bring in school groups, she said.
“There will be an education centre and a dormitory to allow kids to be brought in for a week at a time.”
All buildings would be self-sustainable in terms of providing electricity and processing sewage, and members of local communities would be trained and employed in construction, maintenance and management, she said.
Completing the “circle of life” approach, vegetables would be sourced from the nearby breadbasket communities of Hankey, Loerie and Patensie.
Malan said the aim was to link the existing Chokka Trail to a new heritage trail that would explore the pristine beaches, dunes and fynbos, shellfish middens and ancient feike or stone fish traps.
“Community guides will accompany all walks and hikes.”
Other activities will range from dune tobogganing to exploring the Klasies River digs and interacting with Khoisan beaders, traditional crafters funded by Lotto who could be integrated into the Thyspunt experience.
“So a visit to Thyspunt would be a controlled experience, in order to protect the site, but it would also allow visitors to get up-close and personal with this ancient and beautiful landscape.”
The idea would be to dovetail with the social responsibility programmes of the surrounding wind farms and upgrade access roads.
“We have worked out we could at the very least match the 1 000 permanent jobs that the nuclear project was claiming could be created. The difference is theirs at best would have been for the 65-year life of the plant. Ours will be forever.”
