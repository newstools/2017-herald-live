 ‘The Voice SA’ season two winner Craig Lucas is heading for the Garden Route
The Voice SA season two winner Craig Lucas releases his debut album today while touring the Garden Route with his fellow contestants tonight and tomorrow.

Lucas, who walked away with a recording contract from Universal Music‚ R250 000 in cash‚ a new car and scores of other prizes at the show’s finale in July, said his album Restless was a general depiction of how he dealt with relationships, love and his career.
“A lot of it is about being young and embracing everything that comes with it because as youngsters a lot of the time we’re too old to be kids but also not old enough to deal with the things we go through,” he said.
Restless is a 13-track pop compilation which features nine original songs written by Lucas, two covers and one acoustic version of one of the original tracks.


While his album hits the shelves, Lucas will be performing with five of his fellow The Voice SA contestants at Bravo Lounge, Garden Route Casino in Mossel Bay tonight and The Barn in Plettenberg Bay tomorrow at 8pm.
Other contestants to perform at the show The Voice SA United, are runner-up Josh Ansley, Caroline Grace, Armand Joubert and Johan “Fatman” Brummer.
The group will sing songs they performed on the show as well as some from their albums. Lucas said the show was their way of bringing The Voice SA to the people and closing that particular chapter of their lives.
“We’re very keen on having the people chat with us after the show and we might also have some of our music on sale,” Lucas said.
Tickets for the Mossel Bay show range from R120 to R150, and R150 for the Plettenberg Bay show, available from Computicket.
