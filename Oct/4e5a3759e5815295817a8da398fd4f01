I love a relaxed Sunday where I get to recharge, sleep in late (OK, with two little ones aged two and five perhaps the sleeping in is  wishful thinking) and enjoy brunch with the family.
At my house, brunch is usually whatever the kids are willing to eat and luckily salmon and beetroot are among the troops’ favourites.
With the good weather we have been experiencing I wanted to try something light and simple like salmon and beetroot salad with poached eggs. Serve this salad on toasted bread with homemade garlic mayo.
The pea and asparagus tart is a great vegetarian option for brunch.
SALMON AND BEETROOT SALAD WITH POACHED EGG
Serves 4
400g beetroot (I use baby beets because they are sweeter)
300g salmon fillets, skin off and de-boned
1 cup chopped spring onions
½ teaspoon horseradish
1½ tbsp extra-virgin olive oil
juice of 1 lemon
1 tbsp coriander seeds, lightly toasted and coarsely crushed
4 eggs
baby beetroot leaves, washed to garnish (or use a combination of greens like baby spinach, rocket and watercress)
Preheat oven to 180°C.
Wash beetroot, wrap individually in foil and place on a baking tray. Bake for 40 minutes until a knife easily goes through the unwrapped beetroot.
Once cool enough to handle, peel beetroot and cube. Place in a large bowl.
Cut salmon into cubes roughly the same size as the beetroot. Add salmon, spring onion, horseradish, olive oil, lemon juice and coriander to the beetroot and gently mix to combine. Season with freshly ground black pepper and garnish with baby beetroot leaves. Top with the poached egg.
To poach the eggs: Boil water in a shallow pot. Crack each egg into a separate cup, then pour a little vinegar into each. Use a whisk to create a small vortex in the boiling water, then gently tip in each egg. Cook to your liking and serve with a side of garlic mayo and toast.
Note: If you prefer cooked salmon then pan-fry the fillet before flaking over salad.
ASPARAGUS, PEA AND FETA TART
Serves 6
2½ cups frozen peas, defrosted
grated zest and juice of 1 lemon
4 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for drizzling
1 sheet all butter puff pastry
12 to 14 asparagus spears, peeled and trimmed
150g feta
3 soft-boiled eggs
micro herbs, to garnish (optional)
Salt and Pepper to taste
Preheat oven to 190°C. Line a large baking tray with baking paper.
Put peas in a bowl and crush them. Stir in lemon zest, lemon juice and three tablespoons of the oil. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and set aside.
Put pastry on the prepared tray and bake for about 20 minutes, or until golden brown, puffed up and firm. Remove from oven and set aside to cool to room temperature.
Heat a grill pan to high. Drizzle asparagus with a tablespoon of the olive oil and sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Cook for one to two minutes until grill marks appear.
To assemble the tart, put pastry on a serving or chopping board and top with the crushed pea mixture. Crumble the feta evenly over the tart. Tear the eggs in half and arrange them on the tart. Top with grilled asparagus and sprinkle with sea salt and cracked black pepper. Drizzle with olive oil and scatter over micro herbs, if using.
Note: The pastry has a long cooking time. Once cut, it needs to be able to hold its shape and soak up the juices.
