 Eight suspects were arrested in Port Elizabeth this weekend after they robbed a liquor outlet in Stanford Road for the second time this month.
According to police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu, the suspects were apprehended on Friday afternoon following a car chase with police, shortly after they left the scene of the crime.
“Approximately 11 suspects entered the store and held the staff and patrons at gunpoint,” said Naidu.
“The suspects had previously robbed the store on October 17.
“The patrons were ordered to leave the store and an undisclosed amount of money, cell phones and liquor was taken.”
However, police immediately spotted the Toyota Avanza in which the suspects fled, and a chase ensued.
“They were arrested less than a kilometre away from the crime scene. A firearm, gas gun and liquor were found in the vehicle.”
The suspects will appear in the Gelvandale Magistrate’s Court tomorrow on two cases of business robbery.
“Detectives are also investigating further links to other cases of business robberies in the metro.”
Three more suspects remain at large.
