ANC insider Crispian Olver has revealed how a bruising, year-long campaign to retain Nelson Mandela Bay turned him from former mayor Danny Jordaan’s right-hand man to his nemesis.
In his book, How to Steal a City, The Battle for Nelson Mandela Bay, Olver gives a behind-the-scenes account of the ANC from 2015 when he was appointed to its interim regional leadership.
He described two instances where his relationship with Jordaan soured.
The second incident was at the ANC offices in Florence Matomela House a few months after the ANC lost the Bay in last year’s local government elections.
Olver had returned to Port Elizabeth from Johannesburg to attend a meeting with the campaign team to discuss what had gone wrong.
“With my bodyguard by my side, I elbowed my way through a group of ANC protesters shouting slogans and toyi-toyiing, demanding the resignation of the regional leadership.”
He wrote that ANC official Thembinkosi “Terror” Nante walked into the first-floor boardroom, shouting: “Chippy and Danny lost the election. We will deal with them.”
Olver wrote that he left the room but was told by an administrator how an e-mail, written by him days earlier and detailing what had gone wrong, was being circulated.
He returned to the room where a pale-faced Jordaan walked in, he wrote.
“The discussion moved to the election and I gave a frank assessment of our campaign weaknesses … including Danny’s behaviour, I waited for the explosion.”
Olver quoted Jordaan as saying: “Your report had been circulated to Luthuli House but it is not an official report from the region. You must withdraw it!
“I have briefed my lawyer and I am going to sue you.”
Olver wrote that Jordaan had threatened to expose him as someone who had mismanaged ANC donations.
At the time, Olver thought “bring it on”, while Jordaan blamed the loss on rainy weather and shoddy IEC infrastructure.
“After a while Danny got up and left, the comrades now had the ammunition they wanted: a public admission of my views and a humiliating isolation.”
Olver wrote that, at some point, Nante had entered the room “and the unease became suffocating”.
It was then that Olver made the decision to pack his bags and return to Johannesburg.


Yesterday, Olver said he had not spoken to Jordaan since that day.
But this was not the first time the relationship had soured.
Olver wrote of an incident in April last year during a visit by Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs Minister Des van Rooyen.
Olver had organised Van Rooyen’s visit to the Helenvale Resource Centre.
“When he arrived in Helenvale, Danny went ballistic,” Olver wrote.
“He refused to enter the hall, saying that the DA had taken over the event.
“He was convinced that the people assembled in the hall were all opposition supporters.”
Olver wrote that Jordaan had sent ANC leaders to mobilise party members.
“In the corridor with Des and others standing around us, Danny turned on me.”
Olver claims Jordaan said: “You’ve made a mistake … never do that again.”
In another glimpse into the relationship, Olver wrote he had decided to leave the Bay after a friend told him he no longer had “political cover”.
He wrote a letter to the office of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs, asking to leave.
But Jordaan arranged to meet Olver at the OR Tambo International Airport on Saturday April 23.
“We sat in a secluded lobby and he asked me to explain my concerns.
“The risks are too great for me and I am struggling to carry on,” Olver said he told Jordaan.
Jordaan asked Olver to explain the risks. Olver did, explaining that he feared for his safety, saying: ‘ I’m worried that if I stay I’ll get in your way and we’ll end up fighting. “I feel I no longer have your support.” After Jordaan pleaded with Olver to see the election through, Olver decided to return to the Bay.
Jordaan could not be reached for comment.
