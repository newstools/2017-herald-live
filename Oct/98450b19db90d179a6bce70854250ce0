One neighbour heard men having a huge fight a few hours before the Van Breda axe murders at the De Zalze estate in Stellenbosch – while another heard nothing at all.
Earlier this year‚ Stephanie Op’t Hof testified for the state in the Henri van Breda murder trial, in which he is accused of axing to death his parents, Martin and Theresa, and brother Rudi.
Op’t Hof had said that she heard aggressive male voices engaged in a fight earlier in the evening before the murders‚ and that she was taken aback.
The sounds, the defence had tried unsuccessfully to convince her, were the soundtrack of Star Trek 2.


In the Cape Town High Court yesterday‚ another neighbour, for the defence, said she had heard nothing, despite sound carrying easily at the estate.
Annelize Taljaard said she had not heard any noise on January 26 2015 before going to bed.
It was only the next morning that she became aware something had gone wrong.
But under cross-examination by the state‚ Taljaard conceded there were several buildings between her house and that of the Van Bredas.
“That you didn’t hear something does not mean something didn’t happen‚” Megan Blows said for the state. “And the fact that you didn’t hear anything, doesn’t mean Mrs Op’t Hof did not.”
