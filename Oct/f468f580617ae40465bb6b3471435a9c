One of the men who were shot during an alleged gang related brawl outside McDonald’s in Humewood in the early hours of this morning, has passed away in hospital.
Mervin Draghoener (27) sustained gunshot wounds to his chest and arm. Police are now investigating a case of murder and two cases of attempted murder.
Draghoener, a 16-year-old girl and another person were shot in front of the fast-food outlet in Beach Road at about 2:30am this morning .
The teenager, an innocent bystander caught in the crossfire and shot in the head, is still in ICU.
The other victim, whose age is unknown, was treated and discharged.
Earlier today, police said a group of men, parked in front of McDonald’s, were standing in front of their vehicle and drinking when two unknown men walked past and confronted them.
The two left but returned with about 10 other males.
An argument broke out between the two groups which turned into a physical and shots were then fired.
