Siya Seya
Former Bay comedian Siya Seya is returning to Port Elizabeth after three years to perform at the Athenaeum on Thursday night.
Seya, 33, started his comedy career at the PE Opera House in 2007 but moved to Cape Town two years later to find a bigger market for his craft.
“When I started out, the comedy industry was non-existent in PE, as a result I would struggle to even get radio interviews because there was no market for my work at the time, so I decided to move to Cape Town,” he said.
After spending years creating a name for himself in the mother city, the Motherwell comedian moved to Johannesburg in May last year in search of greener pastures, where he started working with SAPS clerk-turned comedian S’khumba Hlophe and David Kau.
“When I got to Jo’burg I met S’khumba who introduced me to David Kau. He [Kau] booked me to perform at his Blacks Only show this one time and he must have been impressed with my work because he returned with other gigs for me and took me under his wing,” Seya said.


He opened for Kau on his national tour last year and will tour with him again next month. In fact, Kau was so impressed with the Mdantsane-born comedian that he now is his manager.
Seya will also feature in the next season of Mzansi Magic’s Mzansi Comedy Wednesdays.
His show Ndahleka Ndade Ndasuza is at 8pm at the Athenaeum in Central.
Along with the lineup of five comedians will be Bay singer Zimsto Erufini.
Tickets are R100 and available from Siya Mlozana, 082-280-6832.
