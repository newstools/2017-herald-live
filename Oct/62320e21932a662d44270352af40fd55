Glasgow Warriors will be hurting after two European Champions Cup defeats and wary Southern Kings skipper Michael Willemse expects his side to be on the receiving end of a backlash when they face the Scottish side tomorrow.
After chalking up six consecutive PRO14 wins to take the lead in Conference A, the Glasgow outfit were brought back to earth by consecutive Cup defeats against Exeter Chiefs and Leinster.
While Glasgow have been fighting on two fronts, the Kings had a three-week break because they are not eligible to play in the European Cup competition.
Willemse has made it clear that his team can expect a fiery welcome from the slick Scottish outfit on the synthetic pitch at the Scotstoun Stadium.
“Glasgow have had two tough games and they will be hurting and wanting to make an impact on the PRO14 again,” Willemse said.
“They are very good on turnover ball and their tempo is high. They cover all facets of the game very well.
“So during our time off we have done a lot of homework and put our plans in place in different areas to exploit them.
“It will start with our set piece and our attitude going forward. We really want to do well, so we have been focusing on ourselves and what we want to do better. Hopefully we can show that in the game.
“It was really good to sit back a bit and regroup during the break. It was quite a tough opening six games and the break was a blessing for us.
“We have been able to do a lot more homework and focus on the fundamentals we were not able to do prior to the competition.”
Willemse said his team were starting to get used to the vast amount of travelling they had to do to compete in Europe.
“It was tough in the beginning, but I think it is more of a mindset thing. We have to do it. We have put that behind us.
“We are not letting it get to us, and it is getting a bit easier.”
Kings head coach Deon Davids said his team needed to be sound in terms of their execution against the Scottish side.


“Glasgow are unbeaten in PRO14. They play a game of high tempo and they like structured defence,” Davids said.
“They are good at creating more numbers and attacking mismatches.
“So from a defence and kicking point of view we need to be very sound in terms of our execution and we also need to play the games in the right areas.
“Their coach Dave Rennie is an astute coach with an attacking mindset and they like to play the game in the right areas. Glasgow are also lethal from turnover possession.”
Meanwhile, Rennie is rueing his side’s struggle to retain possession after watching their 34-18 defeat to Leinster.
“It’s obviously disappointing,” Rennie said.
“I think we lost the collisions and Leinster were very good. They were very physical, which meant they were able to pin us down our end.”
Rennie, however, is refusing to look too far ahead in the Champions Cup, insisting the focus is now squarely on the visit of the Kings.
He said: “We knew the Champions Cup pool would be tough. We knew we’d have to start well, and we’ve got nothing from two games.
“Our attention goes back to the PRO14 now.
“We certainly want to play a really fast game against the Kings, and with only having to wait a short time for a shot at redemption we’re looking forward to it,” Rennie said.
