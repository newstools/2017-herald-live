Outcry over water, sewage leaks and gaping holes left in roads after repairs
Uitenhage residents believe the Garden Town has become a hazard, with bubbling sewage leaks, open manhole covers and gaping holes left from incomplete infrastructure upgrades. A drive around the once-pristine town revealed a myriad of infrastructure issues, which residents say the Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality had initially attended to.

However, substandard quality and failure to complete jobs led to them having to be recalled to several sites.
Winterhoek Park resident Hilton Camons said areas such as Van Riebeeck Hoogte, Levyvale and Mosel were among those left with huge potholes by municipal workers who replaced a burst water pipe several weeks ago.
“Is there a process in place where the water leak department informs the roads department to go and fill the hole and tar it again?
“The problem is the backlog is so bad that it doesn’t seem to be under any form of control or management,” Camons said.
“Also, on the corner of Daniel Pienaar Street where it turns into Graaff-Reinet Road by Maca Hardware, there is a huge hole that has been that way for two weeks after a large water leak was repaired.
“Sitting at the coffee shop, one witnesses traffic not really knowing what to do or how to negotiate the obstruction and several near-accidents almost happening.”
Maca Hardware owner Andre Horak said: “The municipal officials have been back here after they initially repaired it, because it started leaking again. They came back last week, threw a stone over it and covered it with a packet, as you can see.”
Horak said the issue had been reported several times. However, water continued to bubble out of the newly installed water pipe.

On the corner of Shuttle Street and North Street, sewage has been bubbling out for several months, resident Noxolo Mali said, to the extent of eroding sections of the street.


“Children walk through this sewage every day from school, many of them barefoot. This town is a hazard to its people.
“The municipality has been here many times over the last months, but they just come, look, take photos and go,” Mali said.
Along North Street towards Rosedale are huge potholes which residents said had been filled with tar despite the source of the underground leak not being attended to, resulting in the tar crumbling away again.
In the opposite direction towards Van Riebeeck Hoogte, several exposed manmade holes can be seen.
Garden Town Initiative chairman David McCleland said no one seemed to be monitoring the repairs. “The leak will be reported, then it is fixed, filled with sand, which is either driven or washed away, and then we’re left with a huge hole in the street.
“The municipality can’t constantly rely on the public to report these things. Someone from their side needs to drive around.
“If they opened the ground to fix a leak, it is only logical that the next department would have to return to fill and tar the road that was opened.”
Municipal spokesman Mthubanzi Mniki said the standard procedure when leaks were reported was for the municipality to immediately dispatch a team to the site to do the necessary investigations.
“Each case is dealt with on its individual dynamics,” he said.
“Only temporary repairs have been effected to reduce water wastage – once fittings which the municipality is waiting for have been received, a permanent repair will be effected and trenches backfilled.”
He said in the past three weeks the municipality had accumulated a huge backlog in fixing water leaks across the city.
