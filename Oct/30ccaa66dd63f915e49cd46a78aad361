Foodies and Francophiles alike sat down to a gastronomic feast at Fairview racecourse last weekend, where Bay chef Annelie Oosthuizen joined visiting chef Jean-Alexandre Galmar from the Indian Ocean island of Reunion to present a thrilling three-course menu paired with wine.
Annelie was responsible for the South African starter and dessert while Alex, as he is known, was tasked with injecting the alluring tastes and aromas of his island home into the main course.
These culinary delights made up the Four Hands dinner – an important component of (and fitting finale to) the Alliance Française network’s annual So Chef! programme held in seven cities across South Africa and Lesotho.
“Four Hands” simply refers to the two chefs coming together to present one innovative menu celebrating the best of their respective countries – though, as Annelie points out, she and Alex could not have done it without her very capable all-women team from Petronella Catering working so hard behind the scenes in the kitchen.
The dinner began with “Eastern Cape Surf and Turf” – Annelie’s rustic Karoo dukkah-roasted marrow bones with crisp lamb flank, alikreukel risotto balls, mussel and wild salvia sauce, spekboom salsa and kudu biltong crumble.
This was followed by Alex’s roasted monkfish with citron caviar, mashed sweet-potatoes with a confit of mango ginger and Reunion turmeric, and blue vanilla sauce.
Mango ginger, interestingly, is a member of the ginger family but the root tastes more like raw mango. And blue vanilla refers to the type of vanilla, not the colour of the sauce!
For dessert diners piled into baked milk tart cheesecake with num-num and blueberries, honeybush and rooibos mousse, ranvinsara leaf syrup and salted caramel crunch.
The ravinsara leaves were another ingredient Annelie was introduced to for the first time.
“Alex brought the leaves with him and I infused the sauce for the dessert with it and then strained it,” she said. “It resembles bay leaves and has a strong aroma of nutmeg, cloves and also a little cinnamon, which worked well with the traditional milk tart flavours.”
Being at the crossroads of European, African and Asian cultures, Reunion is a true melting pot when it comes to cuisine.
Alex studied at the Lycée Hôtelier la Renaissance in St Paul, the city of his birth on the western side of the island. He now works in the capital of St Denis, in a well-known restaurant and bar called l’apôteek, but home is in St Marie on the eastern side.
“This was my second time in South Africa. I was there two years ago for the Four Hands dinner in Joburg, Durban and East London,” said Alex, who also cooked in Maseru, Lesotho, this time.
It was also Annelie’s second Four Hands stint, having worked alongside Cyril Bonnard and Marie Wuchner, from France’s Alsace province, in the Bay last year.
“Cyril and Marie are extremely competent and did their training at Michelin Star restaurants,” Annelie said. “It gave me and my staff a lot more confidence to cook with international chefs as it can be quite intimidating.”
She could not have asked for better preparation for this year’s event. “Alex is an easy-going person and fitted in immediately,” she said.
“We tasted our way through each other’s dishes and the wine that was paired with it, gave each other feedback but, most important, encouraged and motivated each other to produce the best food we can.
“When you share a kitchen with chefs of this calibre you do not only represent your own business, you do it for the entire food community in Port Elizabeth to showcase the talent we have here.
“That is what creates stress – you do not want to let anyone down.”
No one was let down – au contraire. The meal was a triumph and Alex, too, appreciated the opportunity to learn.
“It was great sharing with wonderful people,” he said. “Annelie was so professional and lovely.”
He even made a few culinary discoveries of his own: “The biltong powder [used in the starter] was interesting. I like this product!”
Incredibly the two chefs only met in person the day before the dinner, though the Alliance had approached Annelie in June to host the function again. “The first thing I did was google Alex,” she chuckled.
“We started talking on e-mail just to get to know each other a bit and then the planning began.”
She sent him ideas of seasonal Eastern Cape produce and he gave her a list of spices he could bring along. “He sent me his two main meal options and I researched suppliers and availability,” Annelie said. “I knew his knowledge of seafood would be fantastic and that also influenced my decision to choose fish for our main course.” Next she began planning her two courses to ensure a balanced menu.
“I wanted the starter to be a truly Eastern Cape dish and I could go for a richer dish as we served fish for mains. The dessert was a fusion of our two countries.”
Janco Kruger from The Taste Room selected the wines – Graham Beck Gorgeous Pinot Noir/Chardonnay 2016 for the Surf and Turf starter and Alvi’s Drift’s Signature Viognier 2016 for the fish. Dessert was paired with that old favourite – Pierre Jourdan Ratafia.
Annelie has a passion for South African heritage food and enjoys giving it a modern twist. “The best part is making it even more local. The Eastern Cape is the most diverse province when it comes to produce. We have the ocean, the Karoo, the forests on the Garden Route and the sub-tropical Wild Coast.”
Her mentor, chef Francois Ferreira, once told her that industry icon Peter Veldsman had given him this advice as a young chef: “Do not try to be French or Italian. You will never be as good as them when it comes to their cooking, but they will never be as good as you when it comes to South African food.”
Besides last Saturday’s dinner the So Chef! programme also included workshops and other events.
“So Chef! is the only opportunity for the Alliance Française to promote and celebrate French cuisine in PE,” director Charlotte Jarnet said. “It’s an important event on our agenda and offers partnerships within the public and professional environment, as well as with the Department of Basic Education for National Nutrition Week.”
This year’s edition was once again a success, attracting about 170 people throughout the week, she said.
