Despite not committing themselves to a pass percentage for this year’s matrics, Eastern Cape education department bosses are adamant they have done enough to ensure the province does not come last when the results are announced in January.
One of the department’s recent attempts to improve the matric pass rate includes a week-long Spring class this month at the cost of just more than R8-million.
The Eastern Cape has languished at the bottom of provincial matric results for seven years.
In 2013, the Eastern Cape scored 64% and was the only province to achieve under 70%.
Last year’s matrics scored a 59.3% pass rate in the province, making it the only province to achieve under 60%.


Education deputy director-general Ray Tywakadi said that this year the department had decided not to commit to a pass rate but to focus on providing the necessary support and resources to matrics.
“We do not want to exert unnecessary pressure on the matriculants by putting out an expected pass rate,” he said.
“We opted to invest and offer them all the support and resources they need for the province not to come last.” The Spring school took place from October 2 to 6 for cluster B schools, where special focus was given to maths and science pupils.
Cluster B schools include schools in areas such as East London, King Williams’ Town, Uitenhage and Grahamstown.
The department said the R8-million had gone towards paying for tutors, accommodation, catering, transport and security.
Provincial education spokesman Malibongwe Mtima said this was the first time the department had taken initiatives such as tutoring the pupils to improve the matric pass rate.
