Snake expert Mark Marshall with a rinkhalsPicture: Fredlin Adriaan
Bay residents can expect to see fewer snakes slithering around this summer, as a massive drop in sightings of the reptiles has been reported.
This was the message from Sandula Conservation owner and snake expert Mark Marshall, who said the year-on-year trend showed a decrease in snake activity across the metro.
Marshall said that over the past three weeks he had caught six puffadders across the metro compared with the 30 he caught during the same period last year.
“While there are bound to be some sightings in the Bay, I predict that there will be a lot less puff-adders and cobras compared with previous years,” he said.
“However, I think we will see more activity from frog-eating snakes purely because of the recent rains which have led to wetter conditions in the veld.
“That, in turn, leads to an increase in frog populations which would mean that your frog-eating snakes such as night-adders, skaapstekers and redlipped herald snakes would become more active.”
Marshall said that between October last year and January this year he had caught 149 puff adders.
“We can expect to see different snakes out and about this year,” he said.
“Cape cobras and boomslangs like hot, dry weather so they are going to be less active.


“If, however, we see less rain leading up to January, the dynamics could change and more puff-adders would come out.”
Marshall said in addition to the six puff-adders he caught over the past three weeks, he had also caught a rinkhals in the Cows Corner area which had fallen into an empty pool.
“During the entire summer last year we only saw two rinkhals in the Bay area,” he said.
“However, people have to be cautious as the rinkhals are well-known for acting as if they are dead in an attempt to escape harassment.
“They are also well known for climbing into cars. One was found in the garage of a house in Lorraine and another was found basking in Kempston Road in Sidwell.”
Malabar is generally a popular Cape cobra area. Due to recent building developments, Marshall and a team were contracted to remove snakes as part of a plot clearing project.
“During this project alone we caught at least 70 adult snakes, all of which were relocated to nature reserves.”
Snakes are mostly active between 8am and noon and again after sunset.
Anyone who spots a snake can contact Marshall on 082-261-9280.
