There is an old saying that the truth will out. It would seem from the recent exposure of movie magnates, sports stars and administrators, that shame and awkwardness are not enough to silence those who need their truth to be heard.
The #MeToo movement has gained a new impetus with revelations about Hollywood’s Harvey Weinstein and the clichéd casting couch routine.
What puzzles me about the purge is how the public seems surprised by the exposés.
Harvey Weinstein is the product of a sad system that over decades has slowly turned femininity and womanhood into an objectified commodity to be bought and sold.
The power of women has always been a pivotal part of human consciousness. Women were regarded as goddesses to be worshipped and in the archetypal structures of our brains we have honoured their mystery and energy both as lovers and mothers.
The fact that Helen of Troy had a beauty which launched a thousand ships to bring her back to Troy after she eloped, is just one example of this reverence and power.
So how did we get from reverential wonder to Harvey Weinstein?
That slippery path goes through the waypoints of objectification and commodification. As the silver screen of Hollywood replaced the sacred sites of Elysium, money became the main motivator in Tinsel Town.


The emperors of the movie empire are movie moguls named after the greatest Indian empire, the Mughal, which at its height in the late 17th and early 18th centuries, controlled four million square kilometres of the subcontinent,
Industry moguls realised early on that the Helen of Troy-type beauty had the power not only to launch fleets of ships, but also to flood cinemas and offer disproportionate returns on every dollar invested.
The age of the movie sex goddess dawned and monetary returns replaced our ancient reverence for the feminine.
The industry itself coined the phrases “sex object” and “sex symbol” in the 1950s to describe actresses like Marilyn Monroe and Bridget Bardot. Soon women ceased to be mysterious beings but became objects and commodities that could be traded like stock.
Even before the sex object title, Hollywood was full of stories of agents creating bidding wars to sign particular starlets to brand name studios like MGM, Columbia, and Paramount.
So in an industry where women had become objects and commodities, it was an easy assumption for industry bosses Weinstein and Co, to think they could use women for their own pleasure. At some deluded level they believed they had unfettered sexual rights to actresses.
It is as abhorrent as slavery ever was and perhaps more so, as the chains are not visible around limbs and necks but rather in the haunted minds of the enslaved women who bring their beauty and craft to an industry that exploits them in return.
