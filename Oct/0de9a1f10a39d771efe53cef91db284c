In a mystery worthy of a Fast and Furious movie script, a unique, hi-tech supercar steering wheel has vanished without a trace from a race-winning multimillion-rand sports car while in Port Elizabeth.
The specialised, state-of-the-art Lamborghini steering wheel valued at about R50 000 was stolen shortly after its win at an endurance series race at the weekend.
The Drizit Lamborghini Huracan – worth about R4-million – won the Port Elizabeth leg of the Mopar South African Endurance Series held at the Bay’s Aldo Scribante racetrack on Saturday. The event was attended by thousands of spectators.
Durban businessman and the Huracan’s owner, Greg Parton, has since offered a R5 000 reward for anyone who can return the steering wheel or point him in the direction of where it might be.
“This steering wheel is useless to anyone else as this is the only race car of its kind in the country. It is a specialist steering wheel and without it the car cannot function.
This is what the stolen hi-tech steering wheel looks like.
“The steering wheel allows the driver to adjust things like traction control and settings from inside the car,” he said.
“It also has a button which allows the driver to talk to the pits, a pit speed limit button, computer reset button as well as screen page button and light flash button.”
The wheel is thought to have been stolen either at the racetrack after the event or at the Boardwalk Hotel car park between 10.30pm on Saturday and 4am on Sunday.
Parton, who imported the car from Italy earlier this year, said the Lamborghini was loaded onto a trailer behind the race van towing it.
“The Huracan is a stateof-the-art race car capable of over 300km/h with a V10 620hp engine. It is among the fastest cars in South Africa today.”
The race team noticed the steering wheel was missing when they returned to Durban on Monday morning.


“Shortly after the event we took the car back to the hotel where it was parked. It is a very specialist steering wheel and can be removed from the steering column by pulling a locking ring,” Parton said.
“Someone would have to know how to remove it.”
Parton, who owns a fleet of supercars including a Ferrari, said this particular car was his most prized possession.
“Once the car is loaded onto a trailer, the doors cannot open. I think whoever stole it managed to open one of the sliding widows on the car doors.”
No damage was evident on the car.

Asked about opening a criminal case, Parton said he was hoping someone would call him before the police became involved.
Boardwalk security manager Morné Coetzer said they had investigated the incident.
“It is highly unlikely it happened . . . here. We have questioned staff and looked at all possible scenarios. Any normal person would not even know how to unclip that wheel.
“There is also a 24-hour security guard standing about 20m away from where the car was parked.”
Port Elizabeth racing pro and organiser Sparky Bright said news of the theft had rippled through the racing community.
“This will most certainly damage the image of our city. This event was attended by thousands of spectators and brought loads of revenue into the Bay.
“International racing drivers and several racing teams, including their support staff, all booked into guesthouses and hotels.
“It is a very sad day when we host a national event in a major sport and one of the country’s top racers has his equipment stolen.”
The Port Elizabeth event, the fifth leg of the seven-event circuit, attracted about 6 000 spectators and competitors.
