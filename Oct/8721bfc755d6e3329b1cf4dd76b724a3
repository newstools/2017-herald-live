A fortieth birthday party ended in tragedy when a businessman shot dead his three young children before killing himself.
Family members said taxi owner Siyabulela Maziko, 40, shot his sons Luyolo, 8, and Someleze, 3, and his one-year-old daughter, Iminathi.
The children and their father would be buried on Saturday at their home in Caweni village in Kwaiman, near Mqanduli, where the shooting happened.
Maziko’s elder brother, Makhosonke, said the children’s mother and other family members were spared.
He said Maziko took the children on a drive in his Toyota Quantum taxi in the early hours of Saturday.
Police said Maziko shot them and drove back home with the children’s bodies in the taxi.
He then got out, went a short distance and shot himself with a shotgun.
Police spokesman LieutenantColonel Mzukisi Fatyela said two licensed firearms, a 9mm and a shotgun had been taken for ballistic tests.
Makhosonke said: “He [Maziko] was a family man and the children were his darlings. He loved them so much.
“We are baffled as to how my brother inflicted so much pain and killed his young angels, the young souls that he loved so much.”


Fatyela said the incident happened at about 1.45am.
“The bodies of the children were found inside the Toyota Quantum taxi, just behind the front seats,” he said.
“They all had bullet wounds in the chest.
“Four 9mm cartridges were found inside the taxi.”
He said the father’s body was found about 10m away from the taxi.
“We found a shotgun next to the body.”
Makhosonke said he was already at home when he was called by his brother’s wife and told about the killings.
“On my arrival, I went directly to the kombi and found all the children dead,” he said.
“I called out to my brother several times but he ignored my calls.
“As I was driving out of the yard to the police station, I heard a gunshot near the garden. Police and I later found him dead.”
Social Development spokesman Mzukisi Solani said social workers had been sent to provide counselling to the family.
