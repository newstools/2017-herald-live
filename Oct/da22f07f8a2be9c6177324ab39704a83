A gap year project aimed at grooming young people interested in the media and entertainment industry has produced its first youth group of artists.
The Kubo Gap Year Music Project, under directorship of Zukile Mangwana, has mentored new pop group Em&Ree who launch their debut single What I Want with interviews at radio stations around Port Elizabeth today.
The group’s two main members are Ronell Ree and EmLoyde (Em&Ree) – while Lee Saunders and Sean Bluntt joined the programme in February last year.
They received graduation certificates and have recorded a 22-track album to be released on iTunes on November 29.


The musicians are between 20 and 26 years of age and said they were introduced to Mangwana by someone who had worked with Ree and EmLoyde before.
“I started off solo before working with [Ree]. A guy I used to work with told me that Zukile wanted to meet with me and I told him I wasn’t working alone anymore,” EmLoyde said.
After graduating from the programme they will remain signed to the Kubo Records independent record label.
The group said their most memorable performance was at the Music In The Tree Festival in East London in December last year.
Mangwana said the gap year project aimed to assist students with skills in “musical phrasing, compositional structure, and form” over a period of one year.
Applications for next year’s intake are open and interested candidates can contact Mangwana on 083-351-4442 or e-mail kubomedia@gmail.com.
