Dr Iain Butler has done the first cochlear implant on a baby in Port Elizabeth. With him is 13-month-old Deanè Bezuidenhout, who received the implantPicture: Werner Hills
Deanè Bezuidenhout, at just 13 months old , made history twice this week when she became the youngest child to receive cochlear implants in Port Elizabeth and also the first to receive both implants simultaneously.
Her mother, Leigh-Anne Barnard, 32, of Kensington, said she first became troubled about Deanè’s hearing when she failed a hearing test shortly after her birth.
“She also failed another one two weeks later and another a week later. Five weeks later we saw audiologist Kelly Schroeder.
“New tests did not show good results and she was given a trial period with hearing aids.
“These did not work. It was suggested to us that she needed a cochlear implant.
“I wanted a second opinion and that was how I found Dr Iain Butler.
“I went to see him in April. He said she would definitely be a good candidate for a cochlear implant. He suggested that we continue with the hearing aids, but also referred her for speech therapy to Jani Steenkamp.
“I felt very comfortable with Dr Butler. It took the medical aid six months to approve the implants for Deanè. I was very grateful to Medimed Medical because I do not know where we would have found the R500 000 for the surgery.”
Butler said the implants had cost R207 000 each, but they had received the second one at a 20% discount
“We then confirmed a date for the surgery for October 23.


“I was so scared to let my child go into surgery. She is so small. On Sunday night I did not sleep at all. I was very excited but also very nervous.
“We are hoping to switch on the implants on November 16. I am not sure what to expect. All I want is that she will learn how to listen. The rest will come automatically,” she said.
“Deanè is a very happy baby. She is strong-willed and she really keeps us on our toes. She loves playing peek-a-boo. We play it with her every day.
“I know we still have a long way to go. She must still learn what to do with sounds.
“Her dad, Divan Bezuidenhout, 36, and I just want the best for our child,” she said.
Butler said Deanè’s surgery was the first cochlear implant performed at Greenacres Hospital and as far as he knew she was also the youngest to receive cochlear implants in the city.
He explained that he had first done the right ear and then the left. Butler was assisted by Dr Francois Retief. He said Deanè was doing really well.
“The brain is made to receive sound from both ears,” he said.
Butler, who arrived in the city earlier this year, also performed the first cochlear implant in the province at Frere Hospital as part of a public sector programme to introduce this procedure for state patients.
He said Netcare would sponsor a pro deo surgery for a state patient to receive a cochlear implant later this year.
