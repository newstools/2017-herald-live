&nbsp; JUSTELLABELLA Eleanor Douglas-Meyers is a crafty mom from Uitenhage who writes about DIY, parenting, natural hair care, fashion, food and fun on her blog JustEllaBella &nbsp; I love taking pictures of kids in an absolutely non creepy way, I promise&#8230; Well these days I mostly take pictures of one kid (my son Aidan) with some cameo appearances from his cousins. I am often asked how I manage to get such good pictures of him the question is usually from people who have met Aidan and know he runs a mile when he sees a camera and can t understand how I can get him to be more than a blur on social media. So I thought I d share my tips&#8230; Schedule&#8230; Like adults some kids are morning people, others aren t&#8230; know what time suits your brood best Natural light&#8230; Not only do your pictures look much better, but you won t startle them with the flash (this is especially good for moms who have kids who don t like the idea of a camera). Get to their level&#8230; Climb up on things when they do and get down on the floor when you need to. This makes for interesting angles and turns the whole thing into a game, which relaxes them Know your subject&#8230; Some kids can be asked to smile and they do, others need you to be goofy. In my case bribery also works hahaha Get rid of distractions&#8230; (unless you can incorporate them) like if there is a toy or a pet nearby it s likely to distract them, so either put it in the pic or remove it Let them be goofy&#8230; I can t stand posed pictures, that unnatural stance makes me super uncomfortable. Let them be their goofy selves it makes for great mood shots CATCH them unaware&#8230; This one works for my husband as well, hehehe, the best pictures are taken when they don t know it s being taken. &nbsp; Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
