And, to mark the occasion, one lucky Weekend Post reader will win a Col Cacchio meal voucher to the tune of R500 for themselves and a partner.

Today, 25 years later, the Col Cacchio family has expanded to 36 branches around South Africa, employing hundreds of staff and offering an extended menu and friendly, attentive service. The brand is especially known for its excellent gourmet pizzas and main meals, with choice breakfasts also served in a family-friendly environment.

All errors are billed, and Times Media staff members and their families may not enter. The voucher is not transferable or exchangeable for cash, and it will be valid for three years from date of issue. Other terms and conditions as stipulated on the voucher may also apply. The cut-off for entries is noon on Monday, with the winner to be drawn electronically and notified telephonically before the end of the day on Monday.
