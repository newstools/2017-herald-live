I know from personal experience (and observation) that if you are not anointed by the ANC and/or approved by South African white capital, you won t make any progress as far as credit and compensation are concerned. President Jacob Zuma seems justified in not moving an inch to step down from his dubious presidency. We must bear in mind that the internationally-worshipped President Nelson Mandela used Zuma as a shifting spanner to get the Zulu electorate to support or join the ANC. It would have been near-impossible for the KwaZulu-Natal population to support someone who was not a wakithi (one of our own in Zulu). Therefore he helped the ANC ultimately to win and run KZN. While it is not necessarily wrong to worship the nearly-impeccable Madiba, also bear in mind that the international icon and the ANC anointed Zuma as president, to be thrust upon the unthinking voting fodder, long before the snake-charming Gupta troupe had its turn. -Luyanda Marlon Kama, KwaDwesi, Port Elizabeth Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
