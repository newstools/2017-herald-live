Three people were killed and three others injured in a hit-and-run accident in Kwazakhele on Sunday morning. Police spokesman Andre Beetge said a white Quantum minibus ploughed into a group of children in front of Eyethu night club in Njoli Street at about 1.30am. They had been attending a &#8220;pens down&#8221; party. The minibus did not stop and sped away from the scene, Beetge said. He added that the group of about 1000 children made use of about 50 minibus taxis &#8220;to block the road and party and consume alcohol in front of the night club.&#8221; &#8220;The police POPS unit was called in to assist with crowd management at the scene after the accident.&#8221; The Motherwell Cluster Commander, Major General Dawie Rabie has expressed his shock and concern that children are allowed to hold such parties at places where alcohol is consumed. &#8220;Schools and parents must be more proactively involved in the lives of their children especially when school holidays approach. I have also instructed a full investigation into this accident to track down the driver who did not even stop after hitting all these children&#8221; he said. The minibus was found abandoned in Missionvale on Sunday afternoon. &#8220;The owner of this vehicle was traced and has assisted police in an attempt to trace and locate the driver. &#8220;According to the owner the vehicle was taken by the driver without his knowledge after it was supposed to be parked for the night,&#8221; Beetge said. While the family of the three deceased will be identifying their bodies on Monday, police are still looking for the driver and are hoping to make an arrest soon. &nbsp; Share on Facebook Share Share on Twitter Tweet Share on Google Plus Share
