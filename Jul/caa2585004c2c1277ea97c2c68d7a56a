 Siyabonga Jim Picture: Supplied An investigation into the death of Siyabonga Jim will be con- cluded in 25 working days after the family laid a complaint on Monday. A delegation of officials from the Department of Health s dis- trict office, Lunga Kobese Clinic committee and Ward 20 coun- cillor Bhongo Nambiba visited the family on Thursday to con- vey their sympathies and as- sure them an investigation was taking place. Jim, 20, a TB patient, died last Thursday after he was turned away at the Lunga Kobese Clin- ic where he had sought help. Health Department district office official Nolubabalo Bless said a complaint had been re- ceived and would be escalated. We normally deal with minor complaints such as people falling, but when there is death involved we are always shocked, Bless said. Our role is to acknowledge that we have received a com- plaint and explain that there will be time frames. The investigation is a long process but after 25 working days the office will come back to the family with its findings. Bless said they had finished assessing Jim s file and would discuss its content with his mo- ther, Thembela. Aspects that need to be in- vestigated include that Jim was leaving the clinic and that all nurses had called in sick. Jim s mother said the clinic should have called an ambu- lance. The worst thing that hap- pened to my child was for him to find that the clinic was closed. If he had at least col- lapsed inside the clinic, where he could at least be given oxy- gen to help, I would be at peace with this, Thembela said. The clinic being closed killed him. Had the clinic been open he would have been saved, an ambulance would have been called, the mother of five said. I am not at peace at all.
