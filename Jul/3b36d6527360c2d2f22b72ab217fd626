A search is under way for two robbers who attacked an elderly man inside his Ben Kamma home, tied him up and walked out the front door yesterday. Police spokeswoman Colonel Priscilla Naidu said the robbery had happened in Visagie Street at about 9.35am. The 71-year-old man was in the shower when he heard a loud bang and when he went to investigate found the front door kicked in, she said. Two men, one armed with a knife, caught him and threatened to stab him unless he complied with their demands. The suspects demanded the man s wallet and took R3 500 cash, bank cards, a 46-inch Sony television and an air compressor that was inside the garage. A case of house robbery is under investigation.
