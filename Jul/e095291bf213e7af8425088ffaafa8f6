There are currently an estimated 600 000 hearing-impaired people in South Africa.

Earlier this week, the Constitutional Review Committee recommended to parliament that South African Sign Language be given official recognition. The committee responding to a recommen- dation submitted by Deaf South Africa de- clared that the move was long overdue. The committee stated: Deaf SA requested a review of sections 6 (1) and 6 (5) (a) [of the constitution] to include South African Sign Language (SASL) as an official language. Deaf SA was of the opinion that while SASL is well recognised in the constitution and given a special status it was not sufficient to enable deaf people to enjoy all constitutional rights. As its formal recommendation the commit- tee said: The National Assembly and the Na- tional Council of Provinces should facilitate an amendment of the constitution to include SASL as one of South Africa s official languages. Surjoo said: All the lobbying and aware- ness has eventually paid off. She said the deaf community had been cam- paigning for the recognition of SASL for sev- eral years. Way back in 2009 Kyle Springate then a matriculant at Westville Boys High wanted SA Sign Language to be recognised as one of his matric subjects. This led to subsequent court action to advocate for recognition. Recognising SASL as a language would have a significant impact on society Surjoo said. It will encourage the hearing community to learn SASL to communicate with the deaf and hard of hearing. This breaks down the com- munication barrier that exists.
