Shocking details about the thou- sands of images found in a Plettenberg Bay computer engineer s possession were revealed as sentencing proceed- ings began in the Knysna Regional Court yesterday. William Beale, 39, who in February pleaded guilty to just short of 19 000 charges of possession of child pornog- raphy, was arrested in January, 2015 when international police swooped on his seaside home. Some of the images found included the torture and murder of babies as young as only a few days old. As sentencing proceedings started yesterday, magistrate Eugenia Jacobs said that because of the sensitive na- ture of the images in question, these could not be discussed in an open court. We are shocked to the core hearing the horrific details of what the victims in those images had to endure. It is ab- solutely sickening, Women and Men Against Child Abuse Western Cape spokesman Joanne Barrett said. The matter was postponed to Octo- ber 4 for the continuation of sentenc- ing when the state is expected to cross-examine George clinical psychol- ogist Tjaart van der Walt and call an- other expert witness.
