Tony Cox One of South Africa&#8217;s finest guitarists and singer-songwriters will be bringing three shows to the Eastern Cape from Friday to Sunday, September 8 to 10. Multiple award-winning recording artist Tony Cox will be on a short tour of the province to promote his acclaimed Enormous Flowers album, the popular title track of which has been playing on Algoa FM. Cox is mostly reclusive these days and rarely goes out to perform, so this is a fine opportunity to catch a genuine South African musical legend live in concert. While in the Eastern Cape Cox will also share details of two initiatives scheduled for next year the Knysna International Guitar Festival in March and the Player-Inspire programme a drive to promote and inspire performance-excellence and opportunity for young aspiring Southern African musicians and performers. Catch Cox at these venues: Rock Lily in Cape St Francis on Friday September 8 (tickets on 042-940-0174 or rocklily56@gmail.com); The Music Kitchen in Port Elizabeth next Saturday September 9 (tickets on 041-364-1964 or ian.mitch1977@gmail.com); The C-Club in Chintsa, East London next Sunday September 10 (tickets on 043-738-5226 or thecclub@outlook.com).
