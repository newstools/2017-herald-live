More than 49 000 jobs were created in Nelson Mandela Bay through tourism last year. This was revealed by the municipality s portfolio head of economic development, tourism and agriculture, Andrew Whitfield, at the launch of Tourism Month at the Athenaeum yesterday. Welcoming the arrival of Tourism Month a day early alongside officials from the Eastern Cape Parks and Tourism Agency, the group introduced this year s theme of sustainable tourism development. Whitfield said the sector had been identified by the municipality as a key growth sector with great potential to develop and grow the economy and for the creation of much-needed jobs. The mayor has repeatedly said tourism is one of our priority growth sectors for a number of reasons. First because it markets the city and stimulates jobs for residents. He said Nelson Mandela Bay had experienced its most successful summer season in terms of domestic and international visitors last year. He said 260 000 people had visited the city, which came close to the 290 000 during the 2010 Soccer World Cup. Whitfield said if the Bay was going to create a sustainable society it needed to make sure people were empowered with opportunities to sustain their own livelihoods. In 2016, we had 260 000-odd arrivals and created 49 000 jobs. The number has increased by 18 000 in the last three years, Whitfield said. ECPTA chief marketing officer Nopasika Mxunyelwa said the aim this year was to stimulate domestic tourism, which would ultimately stimulate the economy.
