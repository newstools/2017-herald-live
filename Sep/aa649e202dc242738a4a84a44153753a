If the action matches the hype, South African cricket fans will be held spellbound for six weeks during the T20 Global League in November and December. Organisers say an exciting new era of sportainment has dawned and Port Elizabeth cricket lovers will have seven matches to look forward to at a spruced-up St George s Park. Heading the charge for the Nelson Mandela Bay Stars will be master blaster Kevin Pietersen and Proteas spin wizard Imran Tahir, who rank among the biggest drawcards in world cricket. Bay Stars have been dubbed the People s Team and with their extravagant line-up of players will be among the favourites to challenge for honours. Owner Ajay Sethi said the team s name in itself had already made history by being the first sporting team to be named after Nelson Mandela. Cricket attendances have declined dramatically in recent times in South Africa and the Global League is sure to get the turnstiles ticking again. South Africans watched with a tinge of envy when India and Australia hosted all-star T20 bashes that attracted the world s best players. Now South Africa will be the centre of attention for six weeks as the world s best players head to our shores. But it is not only foreigners who will hog the limelight. After securing former England batsman Pietersen as their international marquee player, the Stars also managed to acquire local hero Jon-Jon Smuts to bolster their batting. There are 13 South Africans, two Englishmen and two Pakistanis in the powerhouse Stars squad. Other exciting signings are hard-hitting England batsman Dawid Malan, who was born in South Africa, Proteas wicketkeeper-batsman Heino Kuhn and left-arm Pakistani quick bowler Junaid Khan. This promises to be cricketing spectacle on a scale never witnessed before by South African sports fans. Related
