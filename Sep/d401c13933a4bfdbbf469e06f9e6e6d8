A 43-year-old businessman is expected to appear in the Port Elizabeth Commercial Crimes Court on Friday for fraud and uttering amounting to R24-million. Hawks spokesperson, Captain Anelisa Feni, said that it is alleged that between October and December 2009 the suspect submitted fraudulent tax certificates and false referral letters to the Eastern Cape Department of Education so that the department could award him a tender worth R24-million. The Anti-Corruption Task Team (ACTT) of the Hawks started investigating the alleged fraud in February 2013, Feni said. Related
