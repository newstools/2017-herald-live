South African bonds remained weaker shortly before midday on Friday failing to track a firmer rand amid profit-taking and concern over possible further domestic political ructions. Friday s confirmation by the ANC that presidential hopeful Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma would be sworn as a member of parliament gave credence to some of the speculation around a possible Cabinet reshuffle and at the very least confirms that the president is surrounding himself with more loyalists said Sasfin Securities Bond analysts. Ratings agency Moody s on Wednesday begins its 12th annual sub-Saharan Africa summit in Johannesburg and could also prompt some market-moving comments analysts said. Rand Merchant Bank analyst Gordon Kerr said the strength seen in bonds on Friday was a function of investors taking long positions before the weekend. Despite rumours of a reshuffle at the weekend it looked unlikely that the Treasury would be touched ahead of the ANC s December elective conference said Kerr. With regard to the credit rating agencies Rand Merchant Bank s base case was still for a local currency downgrade in 2018 and a potential reshuffle should not change that he said. At 11.30am on Monday the R186 government bond was bid at 8.435% from Friday s 8.38% and the R207 was at 7.12% from 7.065%. The rand firmed to R12.8913 to the dollar from R12.9651. Related
