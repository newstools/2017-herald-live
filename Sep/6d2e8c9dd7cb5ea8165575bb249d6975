A group of heavily armed robbers could be hiding out in the Eastern Cape after robbing a Fidelity cash-in-transit van outside Bloemfontein on Thursday. That afternoon, the vehicle was spotted near Aliwal North and Eastern Cape police were put on high alert. Officials on the scene confirmed that about R1.2-million had been stolen in the heist. Free State Hawks spokesman Captain Sfiso Nyakane said the incident had happened about 15 km from Bloemfontein. A white AMG Mercedes forced the cash-intransit vehicle off the road. Two occupants were inside the security van and were subsequently disarmed of their 9mm pistols, Nyakane said. Nyakane said that during the heist three shots had been fired from an automatic rifle. By 1pm on Thursday, Eastern Cape police had been roped in to the search and placed on alert after the getaway car was spotted on the N6 outside Aliwal North. The N6 is one of the main routes that leads to Queenstown and East London. No arrests had yet been made, Nyakane said.
