Gary Player imparts a word of wisdom to young golf star Rory McIlroy South Africa s Black Knight of golf, Gary Player, has written a little black book filled with wisdom gleaned over a lifetime of golf around the world. Whether it s phone calls, e-mails, letters or through social media, Player regularly receives requests for advice from the young professionals in the game. And this ranges from how to work on their swings to business decisions they need to make as professional golfers. Now one of the world s most successful golfers, a business icon in the field of golf course design and a devoted family man, has decided to put down some of his best advice in a book. Gary Player s Black Book, co-written with golf writer Michael Vlismas and published by SkyHorse Publishing and with a foreword by Lee Trevino, contains 60 tips from Player on golf, business and life. In the first section of the book, The Questions of Life , the father of six children and grandfather of 22 answers a variety of questions from dealing with criticism to how best to help your children deal with failure. In the second section, Player tackles The Questions of Golf in a technical but highly entertaining way. But he does issue a warning. Please don t see this book as a definitive guide or answer to the questions you are grappling with. I d be far happier if you would simply use this book as another way that helps you hear your own small voice a little better. Related
