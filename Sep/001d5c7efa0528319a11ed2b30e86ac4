One of the people responsible for professional boxing development in the province Mzoli Madyaka has died after a long illness. Madyaka died at his NU4 Mdantsane home aged 84 years old. Madyaka arranged for local boxers to turn professional when local boxing structures had no professional wing. This when he took four amateur boxers to Durban where they graduated to the professional ranks in 1965. Among those boxers was Lawrence Ndzondo who graduated to the paid ranks in the featherweight division. Acting as their manager Madyaka who was a businessman paved way for more boxers to fight for pay leading to the first professional boxing tournament to be organised by Eric Gabelana. Madyaka also played a crucial role in politics when he opened his businesses to serve as meeting places for the African National Congress. The date of his funeral is yet to be announced. &#8211; TimesLIVE Related
