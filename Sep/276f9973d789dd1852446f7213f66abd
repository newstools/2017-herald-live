Try this recipe for a traditional kerrie en rys taken from a new cookery book, Curry by Ishay Govender-Ypma. The freelance food and culture journalist explores South Africa to find stories and recipes from all corners and cultures. This particular recipe is an old favourite, the classic mince curry served at Afrikaner kerkbasaars (fetes) with white rice in small containers. It contains a hint of sweetness with the addition of apricot jam and is usually mild, depending on the masala you use, writes Govender-Yma in her book. It serves four to six and is usually served with white rice, Mrs Ball s chutney and desiccated coconut.
