A 36-year-old police Warrant Officer will appear in the Port Elizabeth Magistrate&#8217;s Court tomorrow (18/09/2017) on charges of theft of state property and negligent loss of a firearm. It is alleged that on Friday, 15 September 2017 , the officer from Mthatha reported a case of robbery which supposedly took place in front of a hotel in Prospect Hill Street in Central. He further alleged that he was robbed of his state firearm, cash and cellphone. Video footage outside the hotel revealed that the police officer was seen meeting two men who got into his vehicle and after a while they exited and left. Further probing revealed that the officer had lied and that the firearm, money and cell phone was given to the men. The member was arrested and detained at SAPS Humewood.
