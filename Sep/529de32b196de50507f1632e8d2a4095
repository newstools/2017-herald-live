A group of third-year arts students from the Nelson Mandela University have been very busy sketching various aspects of the Cathedral of St Mary the Virgin, culminating in an exhibition at this historic place of worship on Saturday, September 9. The students will be donating their art to the cathedral and the sale of these pieces at the exhibition next weekend will help assist with ongoing repair costs to the building. The exhibition will take place at the cathedral in St Mary s Terrace from 9.30am to 3.30pm. Besides being a fundraiser showcasing the students work, the exhibition is also an opportunity for the public to appreciate the beauty and history of the cathedral. Dr Pieter Binsbergen, senior lecturer in the Department of Studio Art, oversaw the students during this project.
