Yet another raucous debate is expected in the National Assembly on Tuesday when the house meets to debate a DA-sponsored motion calling for early elections. Parliament s programming committee agreed yesterday to schedule the debate for September 5. DA chief whip John Steenhuisen and his leader, Mmusi Maimane, tabled the motion three weeks ago buoyed by the outcome of the recent motion of no confidence in the leadership of President Jacob Zuma. This was after Zuma narrowly survived the motion that could have ousted him from office when the secret vote results showed at least 26 ANC MPs had voted with the opposition to remove him from office. National general elections are only due in 2019, but Steenhuisen has argued that the country cannot afford another two years of ANC rule. With over half of South Africans living in abject poverty 9.3-million of our people without work and our economy showing no signs of being able to recover from the recession we need a new beginning he said. The drafters of our constitution foresaw a need to include a provision to allow for early elections for this very purpose. The events of August 8 made it clear that our country desperately needs a new beginning. The ANC can no longer be trusted to govern.
