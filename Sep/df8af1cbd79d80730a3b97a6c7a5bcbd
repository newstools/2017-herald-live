Ousting Nelson Mandela Bay deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani and his lawyer Lionel Trichardt at the Port Elizabeth High Court Picture: Eugene Coetzee A web of machinations, fear-mongering and flagrant disregard for regulations is the only way to describe the chaos that allegedly existed in the Bay s public health department for months on end. The details contained in an independent forensic audit of the department while former deputy mayor Mongameli Bobani was in charge are astounding in that they convey all too vividly the full extent of unacceptable practices. Death threats against those who dared to question what was going on and the blatant patronage displayed in the hiring of workers are just some of the shameful and unethical findings. The report may only be in its draft form, but if even half of what is catalogued is an accurate assessment, it remains a damning indictment against the man who was the metro s second in command. Little wonder then that with mayhem reigning in public health and the UDM s Bobani seemingly orchestrating the creation of a personal fiefdom, the fragile coalition government was brought to the brink of collapse. Against this backdrop, it becomes all too clear what lay at the root of the increasingly acrimonious working relationship between mayor Athol Trollip and his deputy, which inevitably led to Bobani getting the boot. While it remains to be seen how the DA-led coalition deals with the final forensic report, one question begs to be answered. Having seen the draft, it remains incongruous that UDM leader Bantu Holomisa would continue to defend Bobani to the point where management of the city was derailed to the degree it was. It is incumbent on Holomisa to explain himself. Failure to do so will leave him and his party severely tarnished, and do little to engender public confidence in the future of a fractured coalition which has been left so compromised by these fresh revelations.
