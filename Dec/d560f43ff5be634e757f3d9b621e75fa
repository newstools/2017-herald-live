Champ meets Sascoc’s top-10 criterion Even when he looks like he is on a go-slow‚ Chad le Clos still gets the job done. The world 200m butterfly champion was surprised last night when organisers at the Commonwealth Games trials in Durban called his race some 20 minutes early. “I don’t like to make excuses‚ I hadn’t even suited up‚” he said. He won in 1min 58.01sec – slower than the 1:56 he had targeted. “But it was slow‚ let’s be honest‚” the star swimmer said. He had recently warned that because of the hard work he had been doing in training since his last race last month‚ his times would be less than impressive at the Kings Park pool. In the last race of the night, Le Clos won the 100m freestyle in 49.74‚ ahead of Calvyn Justus (50.35) and Leith Shankland (50.51)‚ who also beat the qualifying times. Shankland‚ a year away from becoming a chartered accountant‚ returned to the pool recently after more than two years in retirement, to lose excess weight he had picked up. Having rediscovered the joy of the sport‚ he is gunning for Gold Coast 2018 in April to add to the Games medals he won at Glasgow 2014. By last night, 17 swimmers had achieved the qualifying times set by Swimming SA. But the South African Sports Confederation and Olympic Committee (Sascoc) is demanding that all entrants in individual events be ranked in the top 10 of the Commonwealth. Only a handful of the qualifiers here have fulfilled that criterion so far. Le Clos happens to be one of them. He is ranked No 1 in the world in the 200m ’fly with his 1:53.33 from the world championships‚ but his effort last night places him 10th in the Commonwealth. The qualifying times in effect here correspond to the B standards used for the world championships in Budapest earlier this year. So far only three swimmers have achieved the tougher A standards – which are not required – and Le Clos is not one of them. Tatjana Schoenmaker‚ who missed an Olympic qualification last year by one heartbreaking hundredth of a second‚ is one of them‚ along with Cameron van der Burgh in the 100m breaststroke and Ayrton Sweeney in the 400m individual medley. Schoenmaker went 2:25.83 in the 200m breaststroke in the morning heats and then comfortably won the final in 2:26.46. The duo behind her‚ Port Elizabeth’s Pearson matriculant Kaylene Corbett (2:29.18) and Emily Visagie (2:29.46) also beat the qualifying mark. “It’s not so much about me now‚” Schoenmaker said when asked if her confidence had grown in the past year. “It’s more about motivating the other guys. I’m not top eight in the world yet‚ but my goal is Tokyo 2020.” US-based Marlies Ross‚ after failing to qualify in the 400m IM and 200m freestyle‚ finally achieved her qualifying time in the 200m IM‚ winning in 2:17.33. Chad le Clos fired a warning to his 200m butterfly rivals in Durban last night, showing he was back after his Olympic disaster in that race last year. Le Clos burnt his nearest competitors by nearly five seconds as he steamed to victory at the national championships in 1min 55.00sec,… April 7, 2017 JET-LAGGED and lethargic, veteran Roland Schoeman still blew away the competition to triumph in the 50m butterfly at the SA championships in Durban last night. A winning time of 23.69 seconds gave Schoeman victory by more than half a second, although it was slow by his own high standards. Competing… April 15, 2015 Le Clos can be ‘one of the greats’ in butterfly Ever since Chad Le Clos toppled Michael Phelps as the Olympic 200m butterfly king four years ago, he has wanted to achieve the mantle of greatness too. Today he embarks on realising that dream, when he bids to defend the… August 8, 2016
