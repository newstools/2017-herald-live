Three people were killed in separate tavern incidents across the Eastern Cape yesterday. In the first incident, a woman, 30, was allegedly killed by another woman in a fight that started inside a tavern in St Francis Bay at about 2am. The body has not yet been identified by her family. “After the tavern closed, a spat continued outside which resulted in the fatal stabbing of a woman,” police spokesman Sergeant Majola Nkohli said. Police arrested a 22-year-old woman. Then, a 24-year-old man was arrested for the murder of Vuyisile Davids, 23, in Uitenhage. “At about 2.30am, the two were walking in Caledon Street, Uitenhage, when it is alleged that men coming from a local tavern started quarrelling.
