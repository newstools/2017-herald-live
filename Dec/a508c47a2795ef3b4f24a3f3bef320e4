Here will be something to appease a wide spectrum of musical tastes at tomorrow’s annual Ebubeleni Festival at Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium, including hip-hop, traditional R&B, soul, jazz and more. Mafikizolo is the only act to crack the nod for a return invite two years in a row, thanks to the hot performance of the group’s Nhlanhla Nciza and Theo Kgosinkwe. Here is who else you can look forward to: If Ebubeleni is successful at the new venue in this its sixth year, the organisers hope to make the stadium the festival’s home for the next three years. Gates open at 10am. People can bring their own picnic baskets, cooler boxes and camp chairs. However, no bottles, no beach umbrellas or sharp objects will be allowed into the venue. Although VIP and parking tickets are sold out, there are still tickets on sale for R300 and R250 per person at Computicket, with a R50 surcharge for a cooler box.
