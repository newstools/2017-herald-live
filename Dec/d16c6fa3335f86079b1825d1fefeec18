500ml plain full cream Greek yoghurt
4 tablespoons (60ml) icing sugar or honey
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
Fresh berries to serve (optional) Place the frozen berries, yoghurt, icing sugar and vanilla into a blender and process until creamy, about 2-3 minutes. Once blended, spoon into two small bowls and serve immediately topped with fresh berries. This can also be served in cones. If you are using fresh strawberries, you still need to freeze the mixture.
Transfer to an airtight freezable container and freeze for a minimum of six hours but preferably overnight.
