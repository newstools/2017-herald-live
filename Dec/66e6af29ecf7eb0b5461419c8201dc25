Port Elizabeth police launched a manhunt for four men who escaped police custody within hours of being sentenced in a northern areas’ court on Wednesday. Police spokesman warrant officer Alwin Labans said the four men, who were part of a large group of prisoners, escaped after forcing their way through the roof of the truck that was transporting them to St Albans Prison. In the early hours of Thursday morning police arrested three of the four men who escaped. Police, who are continuing their search for the remaining escapee, said the three arrests had been made within 10 hours of the escape. Labans said while the escapees, who had been sentenced for robbery, were not considered dangerous, members of the public who encountered any of the prisoners or know their whereabouts are requested to contact the police rather than approach them.         A Bloemendal man was shot dead while sitting in a field in Lodewyk Street at about 9am yesterday.
