Police managed to pull over the two suspects on the N2 and‚ on searching the vehicle – a silver Mercedes Benz – discovered R74‚000 in cash and six uncut stones which are suspected to be diamonds. “The two suspects aged 40 and 43‚ who are from Delft‚ could not provide a suitable explanation for being in possession of the cash and the stones‚ and were arrested on suspicion of being in possession of uncut diamonds‚” said Western Cape police spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Andrè Traut.
