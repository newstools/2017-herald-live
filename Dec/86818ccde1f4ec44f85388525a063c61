Twotone music director and Nelson Mandela University jazz lecturer Ulagh Williams will present an evening of holiday favourites, backed by the TwoTone Band, next week. The show, A Jazzy Holiday, will take place at the NMU Bird Street Conservatoire next Friday, December 15. “If you are looking for a more upmarket, intimate alternative to the various outdoor and shopping mall holiday events on offer this December, this is it,” Williams said. “This is definitely one of my favourite gigs every year. I started hosting jazzy Christmas shows with the TwoTone Band back in 2008, and we have since performed our festive season show in many amazing settings, including the erstwhile Uptown Theatres, The Christmas Shop and at the Christmas House in Lovemore Heights.” This year’s show will take on an intimate jazz-club feel at the Bird Street venue, where Williams and the band have staged various shows featuring some of the Bay’s finest jazz talent around the grand piano. “Even though the show is called A Jazzy Holiday, we will also be playing pop hits, Latin music, bluegrass and rock,” she said. “We look forward to a festive evening of singing along to your favourite holiday hits from artists like Frank Sinatra, Elvis Presley, Michael Buble, Dean Martin, Wham, Mariah Carey and many more. “Wear your dancing shoes because we will also be including uptempo classics such as Rocking around the Christmas Tree, Christmas (Baby Please Come Home) and Feliz Navidad.” Williams, on piano and vocals, will be joined by Grant Allison (bass), Bevin Maschaka (drums) and Kyle du Preez (trombone). Well-known Bay crooner Robert Gillmer will also make a guest appearance. Seating is café style and guests are invited to bring along snack baskets. A cash bar is available on site. Doors open at 7pm and the show starts at 7.30pm. Tickets cost R120 and R100 for pensioners. Seats are limited. To book, call 083-627-4686 or e-mail info@twotonemusic.co.za.
